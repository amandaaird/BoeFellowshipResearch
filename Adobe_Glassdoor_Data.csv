19,Best company I have ever worked at,5.0,"- Very smart, down to earth people. It is important for me to be at a company where I can learn from the people around me and I have never felt this is more true than at Adobe. 
- Everyone is very approachable. I have never felt like ""I can't talk to that person"". 
- Adobe as a company actually tries *hard* to do the right thing. When social issues have come up (internal or external), there has been a fairly open discussion and the companies actions have been transparent and understandable even when not everyone agrees with them.
- We have a huge amount of technical freedom and a rich and deep research organization always coming up with new things to try.","- We are still struggling to really nail our server offerings on the creative side. This is an opportunity -- if you are someone who shines in that arena we need you!
- We are dependent on our platform partners to be able to deliver the best experience to our customers. That can be problematic at times. 
- We build a lot of products beyond Photoshop and Acrobat. But not everyone outside Adobe knows that and almost everyone is going to ask you to fix a Photoshop/Acrobat problem at some point in your career (probably many times)",1 person found this review helpful,2021-06-08, Senior Computer Scientist ,San Jose, CA,Current Employee, more than 10 years

The support teams supporting various enterprise products burn the midnight oil working weekends during the summer shutdown, winter shutdown doing an on-call rotation and don't get compensated. The senior management keeps talking about work life balance but when it comes to taking care of employees in a practical way they lack a vision. Other companies like Facebook, Ebay , Cisco who run the 24 hr operations have a dedicated NOC team, thats not the case here in Adobe where the teams are expected to do regular work and support the On call as well.

They do not care about your experience or strengths when considering new opportunities. Management does not lead, they are often unresponsive and unavailable to meet. 

It's very hard to get paid at Adobe. Lists are constantly changing, you are responsible for attrition, there is very little help in generating pipeline and managers are slow/hesitant to approve comp exceptions.

Quotas are unreasonably high and you do not have the support from management, BDRs, Inside Sales or Marketing to grow pipeline. Solutions Consultants are amazing but stretched too thin.

Forecast calls are terrifying. Management looks through opportunities in Salesforce and then interrogates seller in front of entire team.

Also, Adobe does not want to pay you. If you have a nice base, I think that they will give you a list and quota so high it's unattainable. You will not get a raise and if you do it could be applied to your variable.",5 people found this review helpful,2021-05-25, Enterprise Account Executive ,Chicago, IL,Former Employee, more than 1 year

Overall the company has a good vibe and I found it enjoyable 80% of the time. Plenty of latitude to do your own thing and own your space.","Plenty of latitude is mostly due to management apathy and inaction. Horrendous aging codebase shows signs of prolonged hacking and neglect. Senior researchers tend to throw their weight around and outright blockade development they don't agree with. Most other staff are frantically bugfixing for the researchers who avoid code reviews entirely. Your career can easily be stifled falling into the servitude of research staff with endless menial maintenance. This process leads to a revolving door of staff with heavy attrition.

Lots of work life balance, healthcare is great,  there’s a nutritionist on staff, tons of unheard of added perks...all top notch. Adobe executive leadership truly cares and has put a lot of thought and research into making Adobe a great place to work.  But there’s a gap....","After several weeks of onboarding and participating in discovery meetings, it was clear that Adobe VPs and “heads of x” weren’t carrying the culture created by executive leadership down and through to the  individual contributors.  There is also a significant amount of unhappiness within the DX marketing org. Apparently there was a re-org last fall, and few understand their job and those that do, aren’t happy in their new roles. They openly admit they’re not sure how to integrate Workfront resources and because of that, they are pausing on spending time learning until they have to. Layer on top of that no clear direction from Workfront marketing leadership on new messaging and themes. It takes forever to get anything approved by Adobe. All of this creates doubt about the future.

212,Marketo Specific Review,3.0,"Benefits are amazing
Innovative customers 
Awesome events held by Adobe","The only thing that will keep your head above water working with Marketo CS is the benefit of working for Adobe, but the two are still very disconnected. Marketo CSMs are treated like secondhand citizens, your compensation will be lower than what you see listed for an Adobe CSM and if you are not Enterprise you will have an aggressive and arguably unattainable sales goal. This isn't truly Customer Success, it is sales and do not let them tell you it isn't. They have also implemented a new ""level"" system that makes it so they can tell you you are getting promoted without actually giving you any title change or any significant compensation increase. 

Management plays favorites and is extremely cliquey. If you aren't meeting quota you will be treated like scum and if you are meeting quota they will treat you like you got lucky and that you better double it or else. They create a toxic environment of competition between the employees and there is a real high school mean girl mentality with a lot of the CSMs and if you are not in their inner circle you will get to look forward to snide comments about your performance, looks, or really anything they can come up with to try and knock you down a peg. I know several people, including myself, had to start going to therapy to deal with the environment. Thank god Adobe benefits cover it! I still flinch at the sound of a Slack notification from the issues with this team. 

There is also no official training and you can go your entire career here never actually getting into the product. I literally have never actively been inside the Marketo product, they do not even give CSMs a demo environment to test in or be trained at all. The one silver lining in that mess is that you have an SC team that knows what they are doing. I have never worked with more capable people than the people on that team and they can cover you for demos, but it needs to be tied to a new money deal, not troubleshooting with a customer or helping them understand a product they maybe just purchased. 

My advice to people who just want a foot into Adobe, join Marketo it's less competitive than the other products, but keep in mind that management isn't on your side to jump to other teams so if you can network under the radar that's your only chance. They don't want to lose anyone because turnover is already bad. I watched them lose a lot of amazing top performers to other companies because of this. Your opinion doesn't matter here, but the rest of Adobe seems to actually care about career growth.",5 people found this review helpful,2021-01-22, Customer Success Manager ,Denver, CO,Former Employee, more than 1 year

- I worked in the creative cloud team and the work expectations are too much
- They talk about gender equal etc but I don't see it practically, If you are a working mother or female in general, what you speak weights less
- They do not take 360degree feedback during performance reviews, manager just takes the review from one senior engineer whom he believes and your performance is measured based on your relationship with that sr engineer.
- Manager do not say it, but they expect ppl to finish ur sprint work (how much ever time it takes, they only need end result)as well as spend some extra time and contribute to projects outside what you do and also do regular brown bag sessions and presentations, in short work for more than 50hrs per week and thats what they consider to promote you.
- If the manager does not like anything in you, they put on PIP(performance improvement plan), and u should agree to whatever they say, and if they decide to fire you, whatever you try to improve they don't even consider it. 
- So, if they put you on PIP, better quit the company and move to something else

As much as you try to include everyone and work as a team, the previous group does not want to be any part of it. It's there way or the highway.

It is creative and they have great people working there, ESPP is great, and the benefits are amazing","If you are looking for a job in tech sales, stay away from Adobe for a few years until they get big-boy sales ops in place, and until they start treating QBSRs as more than whipping posts for a cost of sales metric. For this review, please know I left under good circumstances. I was not hit as hard with what follows as some, but I got out while the gettin' was good. Adobe sales comp is totally [insert your worst curse word here] messed up. They have a negative dollar to dollar hit to quota for any customer who cancels. This means you inherit a customer who is cancelling a $500K - $1M license and you are immediately that much in the hole. For a relationship you didn't start, and had no influence on. They have tried to ""fix"" it, but their fix was retroactive and I have friends who ended up owing Adobe $20K - $30K in COMPENSATION after the ""fix"". Some people I know haven't seen a commission this year and now owe Adobe more money than their entire variable compensation.

Consulting is a great practice because you get to work with a huge variety of clients on challenging problems. Always a different team and a lot of variety so you learn a ton. I had some amazing opportunities for growth. The values of Adobe as a whole are incredibly strong and make it a great place to work.","Sr Management came in from Big 5 consulting and tried to recreate a sweatshop like you have at bigger firms with recent college grads - expect our teams were 15+ years into their careers. They started treating people like numbers and it turned a job that everyone loved into one that everyone disliked. People don't leave jobs, they leave bad managers. They were always moving the goal post and never took the time to celebrate achievements. But Adobe is a classic case of ""golden handcuffs"" - even when you are unhappy, people stay because the benefits are so good.

Stock options (but Adobe takes their taxes out of your stock credits).
Ability to work from home Wednesdays (but can be taken away on management discretion).
Co-workers are all very intelligent and great Denver office.
Parking and commuter benefits to office off 18th and California 
Well stocked kitchen with snacks, drinks and food.
Lunch provided last two business days of the month.
Two kegs tapped on Friday after 3 PM.
$360 yearly health credit (Most people used for ski pass)
~$1k dropped into HSA for high deductible healthplan per year
Pet insurance offering.","Commissions not being paid on time because ""Someone left the business.""
Compensation plans not being delivered until a quarter of the way through the fiscal year.
Sales targets are increased by 10-20% over last year with less ability to meet them.

Senior management never has answers for direct questions and is not genuine or forthcoming with what's really happening from top down decision making.
Same Senior Management has been promoted for the team's performance, but creates negative culture putting extreme pressure on FLMs that is then transferred to FLM to CSM relationships.
There is a palpable distrust and dislike for senior management throughout the org and cross-functional teams. This makes it difficult for any other team to want to work or support the Commercial CSM org.
Crying, confusion, discomfort and overall uneasiness ripples throughout the entire org regularly.
Feedback is rarely asked for, and when received goes no where.
Renewal team operated without a manager for almost 12 months
Layers of middle management have been added.

Constantly changing and broken quoting tool.
Accounts have changed hands multiple times, which is well known as a major complaint from customers as to why they leave Marketo.
CSMs are the catch all for almost everything related to current customers, where more responsibility is added but compensation is not raised.
Asking to utilize your unlimited PTO is only approved based on your performance.
Favoritism from FLMs to their favorite CSM friends.
No on-boarding  or mentoring for new CSMs when they join the org.
No known promotion track for CSMs.
Overall lack of diversity on the team with only two POC in the entire org.

Competitors are catching up with Marketo in regards to pricing and functionality which is making the CSMs ability to renew or expand customer much harder. 
Customers are expected to spend 8% more per year with almost no additional functionality added to their subscription.
Auto-renewal language added to contracts as sneaky way to make them stay with the company. 
Product reliability has been viewed from customer perspective as going downhill.
Forcing customers to purchase Professional Services to get basic help utilizing the product.

Non-existent training on Marketo product itself.
CSMs are expected to ""learn as they go"" while being the trusted adviser for the customers marketing decision making.",8 people found this review helpful,2020-02-24, Customer Success Manager ,Denver, CO,Current Employee, more than 1 year

- Adobe is a company built on acquisitions, and while the business strategy is usually rock solid, sometimes the comms isn't. It's tough to get any insight about what other business units are doing unless leadership gives a super high level read out during an all hands or there's a specific task that requires collaboration.

431,An Amazing Employer That Wants To Help You Grow,5.0,"A lot of companies expect you to just sit, put your head down, work for 8 hours, and go home. This is NOT that place. Adobe prides itself on its company culture and it shows tremendously through the leadership, its people, and its dedication to innovation. Some cool things about Adobe off the bat: they have a learning fund that encourages you to take classes, go back to school, or even go to conferences to help you develop in your career.  There are a lot of on-site events for holidays, volunteer opportunities, and more so there is always something cool going on. Of course the wellness center is pretty awesome (and there are fitness classes you can take), and the food is pretty on point. 

One major thing that has been a refresher is that Adobe and the people who work here really put an emphasis on constructive and positive feedback: everyone here wants you to succeed. That energy carries throughout the workplace. You also feel very empowered to to help others as well, which creates this community and continuous cycle of trust, positivity, and communication. 

I will say this: Adobe is not for the faint of heart. ""Good enough"" isn't enough here. If you're okay with that, and you're an individual who likes to thrive, push, and succeed, then you will fit in just fine. There will be days where you will be putting in your time, and you'll have a 10 hour day. There are some days where you might leave a little early. What I will say is that you WILL take pride in the work you do, and nothing here is meaningless, at least in my opinion.","A work from home option would be nice, but I can also understand why they'd want people in office as it can be very hard to foster a work culture if employees are remote.",1 person found this review helpful,2019-11-04, Marketing Manager ,San Jose, CA,Current Employee, less than 1 year

I feel like the company, my manager, and my coworkers all support a solid work/life balance. Not only is there a lot of talent at Adobe, but there's an incredible amount of all-around great people and that makes work even more fulfilling. The company shutdowns (1 week off) at the 4th of July and at Christmas are AMAZING. Flexible PTO, sabbatical of 4-6 weeks every 5 years, $10,000 tuition reimbursement every year, four months paternity leave, 6 months maternity leave, employee stock purchase program with a guaranteed 15% ROI every six months, even if the stock dips. Several times when my family has gone to the dentist or doctor the offices are surprised at how great our health insurance is. There's also a decent amount of internal mobility that happens, so Adobe seems supportive of that.","This is hard...I've been with Adobe four years and it still feels like my dream job.

(3) It is an amazing brand and working for Adobe makes you truly proud.","(1) Level of stress really depends on what product you work for. On the Creative Cloud side everyone is somewhat dispensable (it's a monopoly after all), which means it can be a pressure cooker and very political. How else to stand out?

(2) Given that work/life balance is so amazing, the compensation is a bit lower than elsewhere. I think it's totally fair but something to be aware of.

(3) On the Experience Cloud side, Adobe doesn't have the same level of experience as other companies. Adobe is not a traditional Enterprise software company, which means it's somewhat uneven.

I was initially on a centralized doc team full of writers and a manager *(the guy who hired me) and it was good. 2 years in, they decentralized us and all the writers were split up and put under product organizations. Okay cool. The product manager who became my new manager was a nice guy and a great product manager but had ZERO CLUE how to manage a writer and was mostly nonexistent and just cared that my job was being completed, which it was. This was because he had no idea what my daily duties entailed.

 Both my first manager of 2 years and my 2nd manager had nothing but top reviews and ratings to give me.

Then, the product I was working on got canceled and shipped to India. What did they do to the Jr Writer which they brought on, trained, and gave RSUs to convince him into making a long term commitment? They moved me to a new product, right? No, they just laid me off. Great manager reviews, total loyalty and commitment to Adobe, multiple product knowledge of several products across the cloud, and nope.... they just laid me off. 

A couple of my coworkers even complained up the ladder at how it was handled. But nothing changed. I was picked up by Microsoft a month later, but I still find how Adobe handled the situation very unsettling and unprofessional. They instilled a sense of commitment and loyalty into you... and so I ignored several other opportunities that knocked on my door--only to realize that was a mistake because Adobe didn't care about the commitment and loyalty they squeezed out of me.",18 people found this review helpful,2019-06-17, Technical Writer ,Lehi, UT,Former Employee, more than 3 years

The work environment is one where colleagues truly care about each other. It may sound simple but it's really motivating to be at a company where employees care so much about each other and the company cares about you- as a person not just another employee.  There is also a mindset here where leadership is always questioning the status quo, pushing everyone to think bigger and differently, not get complacent, and to push for disruption if it will make us better. For a company over 30 years old and very successful, it's incredible to see and hear our leaders pushing for new ways of thinking so actively. There is no ""old vs. new"" guard that you might see at other companies. In addition to all this, the offices are gorgeous, comfortable, and creative. Food is excellent and subsidized a lot (not free which I like as there's no waste and less entitlement that what I've experienced at other Valley companies).","No real cons from a working perspective, I could get picky and say the elevators get crowded at lunch time and parking is tough if you show up to work late!",24 people found this review helpful,2019-05-26, Anonymous Employee ,San Jose, CA,Current Employee,

528,Isolation and Offshoring,2.0,"Nice office with lots of artwork, generous IT facilities (2 docking stations), food, snacks, cafeteria, generous benefits for BART, Caltrain, and other health / wellness benefits.","Two things were very tough to endure at Adobe: 1. Isolation, 2. Offshoring.

Isolation 

Regarding isolation, this applied to me and my ""coworkers"", but I think others at Adobe were well-integrated with a team. So my experience in the group I worked in could have been unique. But small teams and geographically-distributed teams are subject to LOTS of isolation. In the 3+ years I worked there, I worked in three different physical office buildings, and moved my desk four times. I worked for four different bosses in three remote locations. Most of all, the people I worked with on a day-to-day basis were also geographically dispersed, and, with me moving around a lot, and other people sitting around me moving around, I never felt a sense of community. The people in the desks near me were not on my team and I didn't work with them. Often they were a bit stuck-up, or unfriendly, or from a sales culture that emphasized a ""dressy business casual"" attire for some reason, which was at odds with my more casual garb (despite the fact they were not customer-facing). Moreover, they had little interest in technical subjects, and therefore encounters were often awkward. I always felt under-dressed, but I had no reason to dress up in my role. 

Our group had lots of turnover, so there were constantly new and/or different individuals I worked with. I therefore felt physically isolated, and, a bit psychologically isolated because our team was relatively small and not well-known within Adobe and with customers.

Lastly, there was no good reason given for why I was moved around so much. I almost felt it was at the whims of facilities and/or management.

Offshoring
 
Adobe uses offshoring aggressively for certain teams and I'm not sure why. It didn't work in my department. Resources in India were poorly trained (if at all), stuck in their ways, very bureaucratic, and under the tight control of another managerial organization, so they had little, if any, incentive to work together or get ideas/insight from their counterparts in North America. Most importantly, I found most of my working time spent fixing or redoing a lot of work that was of poor quality that was previously performed by offshore resources. Offshore teams went through significant turnover, but were still firmly in place, even in positions of authority when I left, with a regular set of newcomers to replace people that had resigned or moved to another department. Offshore teams were often extremely slow and error-prone in their work, and often made very bad decisions about processes and tools that had very negative consequences.

Conclusion 

Adobe has lots of great people and products. Unfortunately, in my case, my team at Adobe suffered from much political ""power trips"", isolation, hierarchical, and top-down approaches, and ""upper level"" teams with ""carte blanche"". These people are self-proclaimed experts that will look down at you, always find fault with your work, give no thanks for the hard work and struggles that you do, and generally try hard to bully and make life miserable for you, simply because you are ""below"" them. 

Be careful working at this company. It's a big company, so others' experiences could be more positive. But mine and others were not so pleasant. If you work with offshore teams or in a small or little-known group/department, watch out. The fancy buildings, fancy food, and benefits are nice, but when you are isolated and not respected for your work, that negates all the good things at Adobe.",7 people found this review helpful,2019-02-10, Anonymous Employee ,San Francisco, CA,Former Employee, more than 3 years

Adobe is truly a great company to work for and it shows within the people that you work with. Everyone I've met is incredibly open and my experience so far has been great when it comes to being able to chat with any individual within the company that I am interested in learning from. 

I started off as an intern last summer and was able to return as a full-time employee and it has been great.  The company really pushes for work-life balance and to work smarter than work harder. Upper management within my organization is really open to accommodating to talk to, although I know that one's experience in regards to that can vary based on your org.  I'm super excited to be starting my professional career at Adobe and look forward to how my career will develop at this company.","Food isn't free, but it is subsidized and definitely worth what you're paying for. If it ever becomes free, that would be great! 

Also based on what I've heard from fellow interns, there is a lot of ambiguity in regards to intern to full-time conversion and I hope that experience would be more defined as I had a lot of my peers experience a limbo of being recommended to have the opportunity to return as a full-time employee but end up not receiving any offer.

He even had a dozen years corporate experience with fortune 50 companies.

He apparently was amicable, diplomatic and passionate about joining Adobe and even had a creative background on top of his MBA. But because he didn’t quite fit the ‘profile’ he didn’t get it. Even when the majority of the interview team thought he was the one, but no. 

This is the type of hiring discrimination that stays in the shadows. The Adobe of yesteryear would’ve taken him and his passion. Sadly the tech barrier for race is still up.",11 people found this review helpful,2018-03-27, Program Manager ,San Francisco, CA,Current Employee, more than 5 years

614,Senior Marketing Manager,3.0,"Executive team has a strong vision and they are very focused on growing the business.  Their customers always come first.  

For employees, the company has been doing extremely well with their Cloud offerings so the stock has nearly tripled in price in less than 3 years making a great ROI for employees that get RSUs.   Pay is good/ average compared to other companies in the area.

Lastly, it's a great place to be if you're looking for flexibility and WFH opportunities.  As long as you're doing your job and in the office for key in person meetings, they don't care where you work from.","If you are motivated and career driven, this is not the place for you.  There is no CLEAR path to promotions.  Most of the management/ Director positions are filled with external candidates and it is extremely difficult to move up unless you have an executive sponsor.   Also, they don't conduct formal performance reviews which could be part of the problem.

Adobe often times prides itself in being one of the BEST places to work but HR works hard on these surveys and they are always asking employees to rate them well.   

Company is also very political, more so than other places in the valley so you have to know and gain trust with the right people.   Otherwise, your voice will never be heard.",6 people found this review helpful,2018-03-18, Senior Marketing Manager ,San Jose, CA,Former Employee, less than 1 year

690,Incredible place to be.,5.0,"- Adobe invests in retaining top talent. Experts land here, and then are incentivized heavily to stay. Thus, if you're fortunate enough to be a junior engineer on a team, chances are good that you'll be surrounded by the very best in the industry to help mentor you. I've found my team to be humble, mature, accomplished, and eager to help me improve my skills.

- Because the engineers here are very much at the top of their game, it makes for a very uncompetitive atmosphere - they have little to prove and are very secure with their abilities. As a result, I've found the teams to be incredibly productive and collaborative.

- Adobe has a thoughtful business strategy. It is stable, focused, and driven. It doesn't get swept up in the typical flashy and silly hype surrounding much of the tech industry. It's fun to be part of this larger, sensible vision.

- I came here because the company placed a high value on ethics. Since I've been here, I've seen that these ethical standards are robust, and it makes for an awesome work environment.

- This is one of the few top tech companies that truly wants you to have a good work-life balance. Adobe understands that their employees perform better when they're not burnt out. Adobe understands that it's better to retain top talent and reduce churn than it is to constantly lose key team members and have to get new employees up to speed. This seems like a no-brainer strategy, but if you look at the industry retention rates, you'll see that few companies understand this.

- It's not a cult. I've not had anyone try to feed me kool aid. I really appreciate this, and probably would have gone elsewhere if this weren't the case. Even though I have a high opinion of the company, I've not ever really expressed this at work - it's simply not part of the culture to bleed for the brand or put on a show about how much you love the company.",- I wish its brand were as sexy as some other tech companies.,5 people found this review helpful,2017-07-04, Software Engineer ,San Francisco, CA,Current Employee, more than 1 year

713,Inside sales- circling the drain,2.0,"Good benefits, fountain coke AND pepsi machines, pearl ice, waterless urinals, free sunglasses, completely sealed gaps in bathroom stalls, natural landscaping, goats, a nice perch to look down on all the point product companies below.","Well.... if you are still reading this you must either be very bored and lonely, a recruiter (seriously guys... you are at a 9 with the Linkedin emails and I need you at a 4), a disgruntled previous employee making sure the grass didn't green back up...(pst... it didn't), perhaps a ""sales"" leader looking for a real opinion...

Or maybe you are a prospective new employee, eager to start your sales career and are  looking to base a major career decision on a random, anonymous, TOTALLY unbiased online source (seriously millennials, don't talk to internet strangers). I direct my comments to you though (please take as many grains of salt as your parent's insurance-provided-doctor prescribes).  

You'll notice the other reviewers' chief complaint is with our Sr. dictat... I mean  director... to summarize, he has no successful previous sales experience, has insulated himself with a thick layer of mid-level management, armed himself with a fleet of analysts, doesn't listen to any of his more experienced line managers, and targets people who challenge him then warns others to not ask ""career limiting questions."" He tries to come across as genuine but is basically a male version of Dolores Umbridge.

So how does a marketer take control of an inside sales organization? 

The key is to remember that most of the roles in this org involve finding prospective buyers and setting up demos for our sales team. There are a few roles where you work with an AE to close small deals but these are difficult to work your way into and frankly the juice isn't really worth the squeeze once you make it into that. So more than likely you aren't in ""Sales"" (from Adobe's perspective). Sure -- you are developing valuable skills for your future as a sales professional, and many very successful salespeople cut their teeth in this org, but from Adobe's perspective you are a lead generator (not unlike a marketing email, display ad, paid search term, etc).  Ultimately, a cost of sales -- and costs are meant to be lowered -- which is exactly what the Sr. Director spends most his time on. 

That's how a marketer takes over an inside sales org. Because somebody who spends more time with spreadsheets then people thought they could lower cost of sales and manage people like a marketing campaign- while simultaneously preparing them for sales careers. 

Hopefully Adobe wises up, replaces top leadership with actual sales professionals who can groom the next generation, and stop the hemorrhaging of great sales talent leaving in droves. 

That being said, maybe you will be the transfusion to replace the lost life blood of inside sales...  About 15 spots have opened up and there are a lot more coming soon (like empty first class rooms on the sinking Titanic). Just go in with your eyes open, get Adobe on your resume and then have an exit strategy.

716,What once was a dream is now a nightmare,3.0,"Adobe is a dream and has so many wonderful things to offer.  It does however have a single festering sliver that NEEDS to be pulled.  Among the many pros of working at Adobe here are a few: elite/driven people, amazing products, fast innovation, positive global impact, and benefits that cant be beat.  At one time there was endless growth possibilities.. that was until the sliver got there.","About two years ago leadership changes were made and a marketer was hired to run the Inside Sales Team.  He openly admits that his only sales position throughout his career was a total failure. He claims to be data driven and relies heavily on his data guy.  Both guys think the entire company can be driven on data alone, and not real world logic.  That is basically the demise of everything that has happened since they both started.  To his own detriment he has frequently ignored line management who know better.  Every time there is push-back from line management it is likely ignored or those individuals are singled out and caught in his cross-hairs.  Its very unfortunate because the managers are only making suggestions to better the company and strengthen the team.

They have cut territories, increased quotas, and hired a large staff of analysts to police the quality of work being done.  This staff is being paid nearly a million dollars total per year to micro manage.  Pipeline is starting to dwindle because of the lack of production due to unnecessary babysitting.

718,It's a good company. Experience will largely depend on which organizational and leadership group you are in.,4.0,"Good culture, perks, compensation, maternity/paternity leave, stock plan, friendly people. Most of the organization understands the value of flexibility.  Jerks are largely clustered under leaders hiring more jerks. 

It's a good company. Experience will largely depend on which organizational and leadership group you are in. They have some good mid-level leaders and some aggressively sub-par ones who drive their employees too hard, but probably don't see as much attrition as they should because the company culture and benefits are good overall. 

Most of the mid-level management privately express concerns about how intensely we've hired in India, how they are blocked from hiring elsewhere, how challenging it is to find staff with a mindset of attention to detail, quality work, and an understanding of how to communicate internationally.  They are generally afraid to communicate this to executives. Key executive positions are held by talented Indian leaders who do not appear to understand the extent of these cultural difficulties in hiring at an individual contributor level. Back office and IT are largely a mess because UX focus has been customer-centric for so long, and many small development mistakes have been introduced into systems. Leadership and hiring there could be improved as the complexity of the environment increases.","Most groups need tools and ideas to better manage the volume of meetings and emails consuming people's time.

721,Inside Sales at Adobe is a JOKE,1.0,"Adobe is the best company to work for in Utah, not even close. Comp package, benefits, employee stock plan and the #AdobeLife is elite. ""I Don't Like it, I Love It,"" by Flo Rida and Robin Thicke wrote this jam about Adobe.","Only one problem: Inside Sales leadership. There are no leaders in management, though they have the titles, they cannot do their jobs because their leader appears to be dishonest, condesending and threatened his entire org during the most recent all-hands meeting, to not ask “career limiting questions,” regarding their quotas going up 40% to 125%. Any managers that challenge his ideas are pushed out. His pride is killing Inside Sales at Adobe.

Employees aren't heard, valued or respected. Twelve (12) from Inside Sales have left in the past month, but whats scarier is the amount of people actively looking. When it==the max exodus occurs they won’t care, but they won’t even see if coming because they think all is well in Zion. There are many more that will be gone by the Summer. Our leadership actually reached out to another local company that hired some of the Adobe employees, and demanded that company end existing interviews with all Adobe employees. The evdence is the emails that company sent to the interviewing Adobe employees. HR violation or not, that’s how this leadership behaves. They don’t listen and they think they can solve problems, but with no sales leaders in upper management they often misdiagnose the problem and the solutions just compound problems. This is not just a Lehi problem as two from San Jose left in the last two weeks. Our leadership will handpick specific people and situations and use that best case scenario as the typical example of how things should work every single time.

Leadership has raised quota 4 times mid-year in the last 22 months. Once you hit your number, they move the number back then brag about how they removed the cap that the last leader had. We miss that guy. After one such quota change they retroactively took money from an entire team of ADMs, totaling thousands per ADM. Retroactive folks! He has taken away entire revenue streams, not paid out spiffs, forced ADMs to compete against the field team and doesn’t provide cover over the top when we attempt to execute his plan against our field teams. We have “new quality standards” that are simply just busy work for him to report up some awesome new changes. All of this would be fine if we were being compensated properly to deal with his drama, but production has fallen off a cliff and he bragged that gives him more credibility as a leader. He may be delusional, narcissistic or just threatened by A+ players. I will admit, I’m not a doctor. I have heard comparisons to Lord Farquad, but I have not seen the movie Shrek, so I cannot comment. During our company Christmas party one of the white elephant gifts was rolls of toilet paper with his likeness custom printed on the ultrasoft. Many fought over that gift. During one exit interview he was called out on his threat to the org regarding “career limiting questions” and he denied ever making that comment. He forgot its recrded and that it was attended by nearly 150 people. It’s also cute that he personally posted a positive review of the great job he’s doing here at Adobe, lol. Now he has the other Inside Sales managers posting positive reviews on Glassdoor.

Quotas have doubled without a clear explanation as to why. Inside Sales leadership has little sales experience which is apparent and has resulted in changes to process which has affected overall pipeline for Adobe. Do to the lack of pipeline, there is now unnecessary stress being felt from the executive level all the way down. Lack of trust in inside sales Sr. leadership has resulted in top talent to leave. Morale is at all time low which is being shrugged off. Not only have we lost top inside sales talent, we are now starting to lose line managers that can no longer refrain from expressing their concerns. I'm afraid that concerns within our org fall on deaf ears as upper management is too prideful to admit that they are wrong and unwilling to make changes.

Additionally, if you are a performer, the workload will just pile on to that individual. There area a lot of under-performers who are content with just doing minimal amount of work and much of the management enjoys this type who don't have any drive.

Adobe offers stability and respect for its employees. There are enough fun activities, but the lights turn off at 7pm and you're encouraged to go home and have a life outside of work. HR and management listens to you and there are many employees whose job is to make Adobe a better, safer, more diverse workplace.

As a company that largely fosters creativity, the company mission is sound and you can feel good working for them.","For computer scientists, the pay/perks are not what you'd find at other big tech companies (but if you're getting paid at that pay grade you probably have no reason to complain).",1 person found this review helpful,2016-03-04, Computer Scientist ,San Jose, CA,Former Employee, more than 1 year

902,The worst culture ever,1.0,"The money, the perception that the company name gives you in the job market when you decide you're done with this nonsense.","The culture is the worst I have seen in my professional career. The company is mostly run by white males who give lip service to diversity but have zero interest in it. There is a huge amount of narcissism and a bias towards people who talk nonstop about how great the company is and brown nose.  It's like the worst frat you've ever seen. Most salespeople have never used the products they are selling. They have their sales scripts but that's it.

You are expected to attend meetings and engage in typical workaholic behaviors if you want to go anywhere or save your job.  They literally openly threaten firing during conferences and meetings if you do not praticipate to their liking. I have spoken to a number of people who have missed family events years in a row or missed milestones like their child walking for the first time because they are expected to attend grueling meetings regardless. It is very clear that these people must give total control of their homelife to their spouse or partner, otherwise their home would be in shambles.

Expect poor to no training or mentorship.  When you struggle, you will be blamed. You'll be pointed to the web with countless trainings that will teach you zero valuable skills.  Your mentor will end up being someone who is way too busy trying to be a superstar suck up to actually mentor you. When you fail you'll be labeled as ""just not adobe material.""

The processes are a bureaucratic nightmare that would make George Orwell say ""really? That seems over the top.""  Expect that any process will require you to call or interact with offshore resources in India who struggle to communicate and have zero understanding of the process beyond their link in the chain.

It is without question the least empathic work environment I have ever seen. God forbid you bring up anything unpleasant like a death in the family or anything similar as just small talk.

Also the direct manager stopped sending birthday celebration emails, congratulations for work anniversary, I felt the only point of work was the number of billed hours.

After each change, it is more difficult for Account Executives to make money (it is difficult to make good money at Adobe now days, great money is a thing of the past).  Multiple AE's brought in large deals last year, and the year before, so Adobe officially capped them and did not pay commission above a certain amount (of course this message from management was delivered to the AE's after they sold the large contracts, happy selling!).  

Quotas at Adobe are usually 3 to 4 times higher than the average AE's quota at a competitor or other software company.  Quotas have increased by 40%+ each year over the past 3 years.  Additionally, upper sales management is choosing to micro-manage and apply pressure to bring deals forward (that aren't ready) as pressure mounts to perform on Wall Street.  Have you ever had a manager tell you to bring a deal forward that isn't ready?  It's not fun and it sets you up for failure even though management knows that the deal isn't ready.

1205,Best job I've had so far!,5.0,"I've worked at a few different tech companies which were *vastly* different in culture, vision, and size.  The first was a small startup which had me doing everything from writing code to answering phones.  The next was a medical device company where a bug in the code could literally put lives at risk.  Next was the largest software company in the world, which was the most intense place I've ever worked at.

Then came Adobe, the best place I've worked at so far:

- AWESOME pay!  I was already giddy from my starting salary when they hired me.  Now, 5 years later, it's up 25% on top of that, with (usually) yearly stock and cash awards, along with an additional %-of-your-yearly-salary bonus for being a Lead.  By far and large, the pay more than makes up for any other shortcoming/nit-pick I have about Adobe.

- An Employee Stock Purchase Plan which has been very good to us the last few years

- Unlike the other companies I worked for, Adobe (in San Jose) has a higher-than-average median age, which means families, which means the building is mostly deserted by 5.30pm

- Private offices!  If you've been with the company long enough (3+ years), you'll probably get an office with a window.

- VERY easy to move around and take on leadership roles, if you've got the right attitude.  I mention in the ""Cons"" section that engineering is filled with introverts, so if you're able to step out of that area, the sky's the limit.

- Free refreshments and (limited) healthy snacks in the break room.

- Free meals for engineers that stay until 6.45pm

- Well-outfitted onsite gym (with showers & lockers)

- Best-looking set of buildings in the city.  There are out-of-towners taking pictures of the building all the time.

- Friday beer-bash events","- Hardware refresh policy (for new monitors/laptops) is a bit stingy.  You only get automatic hardware updates every 3years.  However, if you have good reason for it, management may agree to new hardware earlier than that.

- Health Insurance options are the same as all other companies around here, but unlike Google and nearby startups, Adobe only covers 85% of the health insurance benefits (instead of 100%)

- The people here (in San Jose) are a bit on the older side, so there's not as much of the youthful spirit as you'd see in companies like Google or Facebook.

Promotions are given out based on friendship and politics to people that don't deserve them and aren't capable of leading or managing others. 

At least at Adobe Digital, employees are treated very unfairly, talked down to, reprimanded both in front of others and privately and you are only as good as you next mistake. You are given way too much work for one person to handle and then chastised when you make one mistake. And this is not just my opinion, the proof is in the pudding. In San Francisco, the Adobe Digital team has hired over a dozen people in the last 2 years with all but one quitting prior to reaching their year mark (and Adobe pays out nice money for reaching a year). Yet they still tell interviewees what a wonderful place to work it is.

Meanwhile, the managers of these disgruntled employees keep getting promoted and praised because the consulting group is still very profitable based on the premium they get for carrying the Adobe name. They are profitable and that seems to be all the VPs care about. The incredible part is that upper management is aware of these issues because of countless HR complaints, surveys and the out-of-control turnover, but they'd rather turn over the entire work force than fire the people responsible for the mess.

1411,Adobe needs to change dramatically to keep thriving.,3.0,"The compensation at Adobe is difficult to beat.  Certainly the benefits and the stock plan are excellent.  The company ""cares"" about its employees and continually offers great incentives to them.  The vacation benefits in particular are amazing.  It's quite hard to feel chained to your desk when you have many weeks of time off, and a sabbatical at regular intervals in your career.  Management is often very flexible in allowing for additional work/life balance.

Additionally there are very many innately solid and smart individuals working for Adobe, and a good number of truly passionate individuals with deep industry knowledge.  The culture at Adobe is collaborative, which is a way of saying that mutual respect and generally being ""nice"" is considered virtuous.  The executives are not fearsome tyrants; although some have had serious ADD, they are often receptive and genuine on an interpersonal level.

I do believe that Adobe authentically has set high standards for itself and attempts to deal straightforwardly with its employees and its customers.  The company's core values are laudable, as is their visible commitment (very much so now with the wind spires in the San Jose office!) to conservation, energy efficiency, and community involvement.","Adobe as a company faces tremendous challenges in both its culture and its business.  The core business, Creative Suites, seems to have eroded somewhat in the last few years, and no clear vision has arisen to take its place.   Instead the company has resorted to brutal cost cutting measures, while making very few real changes in its internal culture or its business model.

The peanut butter analogy that was so famously applied to Yahoo years ago applies equally to Adobe today.  The only real difference between the companies seems to be the monopolistic lock that Adobe has on its highly profitable but aging core businesses.  But that doesn't make the company immune to the erosion of its culture or its values, and ultimately, its stock price.

And the culture that I described above as having so many positive attributes, I'm sorry to say, is the cause of Adobe's downfall.  The management structure is byzantine.  In my business, real communication up the chain was non-existent.  Largely this is because the company adopted rigid processes for software development that silo people away from one another.  The notion of a bunch of smart people sweating it out in a room with a whiteboard, trying cool stuff, and then putting in the pain and tears and blood to make a new product is largely non-existent there.  It's been replaced by bulleted lists, emails, calendars, and a low level of scrutiny into the day-to-day work habits and abilities of individuals.  Getting along matters the most at Adobe; its collaborative culture encourages not making waves.  Just work with the process, get things done, and you're secure.  Cash in your stock, and move on to the next project.  Take a nice vacation if you're feeling a little burned out.

This kind of job cannot exist for very long in the tech industry.  The proof is in the pudding.  At Adobe there is a furious pace of offshoring and layoffs.  Yet the culture doesn't change.  People still while away hours in unproductive, mind-numbing meetings.  Managers don't communicate with individuals except via email or rigidly scheduled and over-produced ""all hands"" meetings.  

Of course I am describing my experience in one business at Adobe.  But I did have direct experience working with other businesses as well.  In my time there i saw inconsistency in how different businesses are managed.  Creative Suites and the Platform teams seemed to be pretty tight ships, by comparison, so some of the above may not apply.  But even then the management structure and lack of communication created huge delays in product development, as well as the creation of ill-concieved ""peanut butter"" products that only went halfway in meeting a real market need.

Having said that, I want to touch on what is the most damning fact of Adobe's culture and what should cause most employees there to worry, especially the executive team:

There is simply no common idea of what Adobe is, what it does, and what it will be doing in the future.  Here's evidence:  the CTO barely has anything to do with Creative Suites, in spite of it being 2/3 of the company's business!  

What is Adobe's technology vision?  What is its real core mission?  What business models will sustain it in the future?

Today it seems to be:  release CS5 and pray it outsells CS4.  Go half-in on a broad base of satellite products that may or may not be well-conceived.  Continue supporting the Flash albatross and AIR.  To what end?  Revenue growth?  Good karma?  Who knows?  Was buying Omniture, a money-losing business, for a tremendous amount of money a good idea?  What core vision did it fit into?

I know it's a Valley cliche, but Adobe really needs a lot of that Vision Thing.  And soon.  And the culture has to get a lot smaller, and a lot hungrier, for it to act on that vision when it does come along.",2 people found this review helpful,2010-03-29, Sr Computer Scientist ,San Jose, CA,Former Employee,

Benefits are good and you can enjoy low employee price of Adobe's premium products, such as creative suites, etc. San Jose office is a green building. The facility is very good.

Also in the San Jose office, you can access to an in-house Gym with many good equipments.","There are several downsides here. First, the core business is largely built upon traditional consumer shrink-wrapped software business model. The model is pretty much dead, threaten by free software, open source, subscription, Saas, etc. The company has not found a new growth area yet. Its enterprise product has not found a market segment after four years trying to create one. Its Saas offering faces many other players which entered this market much earlier than Adobe.

1471,Good pay and stodgy culture = Tech Worker Retirement Home,2.0,"The salary at is pretty good, relative to other tech companies in the valley.  The work-life balance is also very good. The brand looks great on a resume, and generally carries some clout when dealing with partners and customers.  Further, you generally look cool at a party when you say you work with Adobe.","Adobe feels and operates like a much larger company than it actually is. I'm not sure if it has to do with a culture rooted in PDF and form handling, but Adobe moves in a very slow and bureaucratic fashion.  Execs like to say it's a ""conservative"" culture --but on a day-to-day basis it just feels like I work for General Motors or some mega-corp.

Adobe's future is questionable. They continue to do a great job extracting revenue from their existing products, but have repeatedly failed to re-invent themselves or develop a new major revenue stream.  At this rate they are destined to end up more like Xerox or Kodak than IBM or GE.  Right now they are stuck operationally, and strategically as a packaged channel software company. This makes exploring new business models (SaaS, Enterprise, etc.) nearly impossible despite a rhetorical ethos of innovation.

Promotions are hard to come by at Adobe.  They fancy themselves a very flat organization and it's nearly impossible to get promoted to Director or VP.  This flat org approach means the opportunity for career advancement are very limited.  It also means that Adobe has a strange hero-worship for their executives. Coming from Macromedia, where our execs were just normal people (though often very bright), this is pretty weird.

Adobe doesn't value intellect in hiring or promoting.  They would much rather bring in a hired gun (castoff) from another tech company , with a mediocre resume, versus promoting or developing internal candidates of promise. This has played out time and time again, with employees leaving, and re-joining several years later in order to get a promotion.  It also plays out daily in terms of work interactions, where I'm forced to deal with people that just aren't very bright.  

Last off, Adobe's best asset (work-life balance) is also one of it's major drawbacks.  For the most part, employees don't feel a sense of ownership or a strong desire to do the right thing for the customers or the business.  There is a fairly pervasive ""punch-the-clock"" mentality.  The ""that's not my job"" and ""that decision is above my paygrade"" attitudes are rampant throughout the company.  It reminds me of when I worked in a factory full of teamsters.  Punch in at 8, punch out at 5, do your job and nothing more, and do anything possible to avoid extra work.

About the only thing missing is onsite childcare benefits (though i don't have children currently)","The San Jose office is much more conservative than the SF office.

Our people and our customers are cool--artists, designers, developers.  That is the best audience to serve (IMO). There are still lots of opportunities to do great things at Adobe.","As it has gotten larger, and more distributed globally, the layers of bureaucracy and business processes are too heavy, and the company moves slower than ideal.  Senior Management has mostly (but not always) tended to be a bit conservative.

The most common complaint was that the system of title leveling and organizational design made it very difficult for people to get promoted.  One should note that because of Adobe's approach, a person who might expect to be a VP at another company would likely be a Director at Adobe, and Director a Manager, and so forth. There are some benefits to this approach (the company is not littered with a million VPs who actually have little responsibility) but all in all I think it is too conservative and makes it hard for folks in the middle to move up in terms of their title without leaving the company.

If you are hired on, you'll likely be there a long time if you want to (and most people do want to).","Because it's a large company, with offices all over the world, thousands of employees and may cultures working together, it can sometimes take a long time to make changes.  This could be a good thing, since it usually means there are a lot of people involved for checks and balances, but if a change needs to happen soon, the size of the company can slow it down.  Another aspect of Adobe that is usually a positive but can sometimes be viewed negatively is that most people have their own office.  This is great if you need peace and quite to work effectively but in some cases, it's easy to become isolated from others in the company if you never leave your office.",Be the first to find this review helpful,2008-06-02, Media Specialist ,Seattle, WA,Current Employee,

1548,Adobe makes great products!,5.0,Great company to work for with high level of respect for employees and customers.  Adobe and it's employees live their values.  Adobe builds great products and engenders a lot of customer loyalty by treating it's customers and employees right.,Not enough reliance on internal experts to drive product direction; not enough vision set down from senior management to coalesce a strategy,Be the first to find this review helpful,2008-04-24, Design Researcher ,San Francisco, CA,Current Employee,
1549,"Adobe: my platform from which to transform the world, and improve the future of digital media.",5.0,"We create tools that enable creative expression that's never before been possible! Adobe understands what it takes to ship world-class software; we have a software development process that's sane, challenging, intuitive, and which ensures that we maintain a semblance of work / life balance.","Our competence is sometimes punished by further responsibility.

Here are some BIGGER numbers to beat. Recession? WHAT recession?"" 

I kid, but Adobe wrings every bit of productivity from its groups. Our 'modular' approach to software development allows this to work.

There is sense of ownership of the products people work on. They take a great deal of pride in the products.

He took projects at a much higher level then I did. Furthermore, I worked more closely with my co-worker then my manager. I did not get much of a performance review at the end of my employment.
