6,"Very booooring job, but you do get guaranteed overtime (if you're into that)",3.0,"Laid back (especially when working remotely), easy way to get video game experience on your resume (though don't expect it to be your ""way in""), the work itself is pretty straightforward and easy to get the hang of, management seems empathetic and has been making good changes so far, and overtime pay is nice if you're willing to go into a work grind.","As the title says, very boring, especially if you're already not a big fan of COD or shooters (there's NOT a good chance you'll work on any other title when you're starting out). We've been playing the same game mode all day, almost everyday (usually 50 hours a week, sometimes more) for over a month now, and the game mode wasn't even that fun to start with, let alone the game itself, which is one of the lamest in the series to date IMO. Hopefully that will give you a picture of what the job is like. Your KPI is also the amount of bugs that you've written (they care a bit about quality, but quantity is mostly what they look for). But, It's really hard to find and write new bugs when you've been playing the same game mode everyday, especially when you're competing with almost 50 other people to call out the bugs first. Unless you're a go-getter, love the corporate structure, really want to move up in Activision QA (don't expect to work your way up to a dev job from this position), and/or can, somehow, not get enough of COD, then you won't likely see any major raises or promotions.",Be the first to find this review helpful,2021-06-02, Manual QA Tester ,Austin, TX,Current Employee, less than 1 year

Your colleagues will quickly become one of the main reasons you stay working at this company. There are plenty of development offerings available but most of it is eLearning. The company has been pretty flexible in terms of working arrangements and has a standard benefits package.

Not all employees identify as gamers and most have fairly diverse backgrounds at the corporate level. 

VP and below are all very accessible and approachable.

The CEO and other leaders are clearly doing something right as the company is doing so well, however, employees don't seem to reap the benefits with total comp, promotions, etc.

We make great products and have an overall fun environment.","People are expected to do 5 people's jobs - there is never enough headcount for what we are expected to produce. 

There is no culture or identity for Activision Blizzard. As the corporate ""parent company"" who shares an office with Activision Publishing, we sort of piggy back off their values and culture.

SVP and above are not in tune with the company. The leaders of the different operating companies don't seem to talk and are often not on the same page. It seems like AB leaders block a lot of good that is being requested.

The pay doesn't make sense and is not transparent. There are SO many boomerang hires, that is pretty telling that people aren't being promoted or paid what they should.

There are no leaders of color, and very few women leaders. Promotions are very hard to come by and we seem to go external most of the time for new roles rather than from within.",2 people found this review helpful,2021-01-04, Talent Acquisition ,Santa Monica, CA,Current Employee, more than 3 years

This attention to their people during an especially unique circumstance has made the organization standout in my mind in comparison to its contemporaries.","An inherent aspect of working for a Fortune 500 company can be the difficulty to connect with colleagues around the vast infrastructure of the organization.

78,Bad culture and rigid old-school micro-management style senior management team,2.0,Fun multi-cultural environment where you'll get to learn a lot but avoid staying for more than 6-9 months.,"1) Blame culture trickling down from the top to the bottom:

You're always in fear of reporting issues as you'll be the one who gets reprimanded and questioned ""How!?"" and ""Why did you spot this only NOW!!?"". This results in people trying to cover up for each other and hide issues from management.

There's a strong focus on blaming the people not the process; If the process is extremely prone to human-error then humans must simply not make errors. Meanwhile, the process will never get re-examined, because senior management will say ""This is how we've done it for years""

2) Low autonomy combined with low trust results in a micro-management heavy culture:

Politics between different departments with QA inferiority complex, once you join as a lowly QA peasant, you'll always be looked down upon by management as a QA peasant no matter how far you make it.

3) Extremely low-tech:
For a leading video game publisher, Activision (Dublin) is at least 5-8 years behind in technology. Be prepared to relive the spirit of the 90s with emails and excel sheets used for nearly everything. No investment in tools whatsoever.

4) Complete lack of transparency from the senior management:

Decisions involving you will be made at a top level and will not be communicated or explained to a peasant such as yourself until the last minute, this will not change even if you become a team leader.

83,Not what everyone thinks,1.0,"Coolish swag
Dogs on campus!!! (Pre-COVID)
Environment: Nothing better than being on Blizzard campus and being in front of the Orc statue!","Personally if I could have given Blizzard half a star I would have.

Working for Blizzard is one of the most horrible experiences I ever had to go through. That feeling of,""OMG I want to work for Blizzard."" Quickly changes when you start and becomes,""OMG what have I done?!""

Management: Good ol boys club. 98% of management have been there for 10+ years and were a part of the company during its ""golden years"". Management is stale and tends to shun/discriminate against you if you do not agree to their every word. Their word is the bible and shall not be questioned! They hand out write-ups like its candy and tend to keep to the groups of tenured people. If you complain to HR, they say they listen but normally just ignore you and then say you never told them. Overall, management is just bad here.

Fellow Employees: Some are cool I'll admit but most of them feel like they are high and mighty because they've been there for so long. If you're able to find a good click of people then thats great! I'm lucky I have but I have seen new employees come on board and are shunned and felt to be unwelcome. I was one of those people until I found a group I clicked with.

""Diversity"": Blizzard preaches that they are very diverse but when it comes to hiring, 8/10 will be men. There are barely any women in leadership roles and those that are tend to be ignored or overruled by those higher than them. The clubs that are on campus are run by fellow employees but even that is a mess. With the amount of work everyone has on their plate, their last thought is on groups. Many events will be ""planned"" and then cancelled which isn't necessarily anyone's fault but it proves that diversity and accepting those who are different really isn't a top priority. 

Advancement: Not gonna happen. Like I said, everyone in a management position has been there for 10+ years and they're not moving anywhere so your only option is to look for a better position outside the company. From what I have seen there is currently a very high turnover rate at Blizzard. 

Pay: Low of the low. If you work at Blizzard and want to live in Irvine, you'll either need a lot of roommates to cover the bills or someone who is throwing out money to you. Pay raises are very rare! Also, don't ask for a raise. If you ever do you're looked at with disgust and told to get back to work.

Work/Life balance: LOL! Oh and never ask to work from home (Pre-COVID) Current higher management is very anti-work from home.",7 people found this review helpful,2020-07-24, Administration ,Irvine, CA,Current Employee, more than 3 years

Working in Marketing Creative was the most dehumanizing experience of my career. Half of the management in the department got their position by being in the right place at the right time. The other half was hired in, not based on their creative ability, but on how well they talk. The constant, high level of turnover - even after pay increases - should be eye opening but the remaining employees just get worked harder to make the management look good.

98,Activision Blizzard Media Experience,1.0,"There is big and shiny marketing that goes into bringing on top talent with the promise of providing access to audiences across Activision, Blizzard and King, but which is merely King. This results in very talented individuals coming aboard in the san francisco office (as well as NYC), but those individuals soon realize their talents are wasted working for a division that should be outsourced. Top talent leaves within 24 months. Top talent should avoid this employer moving forward.","I have never been a part of an organization so utterly lacking in culture. The San Francisco office is a morgue. Leadership does not interact with anybody, preferring to lock themselves in rooms all day, ""solving"" problems the company does not care about. The politics and self-importance are horrific and disgusting. It is remarkable that anybody is still there, and I heard regularly from my peer group that those who do stay do so purely for financial reasons (the pay is competitive outside of equity). The leadership team has no chemistry, the president is out over his skis in terms of experience, the marketing team is full of people who have no prior marketing experience, the product team has never actually shipped a  product, and the sales team is embarrassed by the products that they bring to market. Most importantly, the division is not a priority to the company, but a sideshow that they wish to see revenue from, but otherwise wish would disappear.

The contract you will get will depend on needs.

You can know if you get extended on your last week of contract, even if you ask the manager before, they rarely know before. How good you are doesn't matter, you are just a number there.

Working there also means some months, you will be on shifts and work several weekends in a row.

The caliber of talent, the amount of fun we all have, the (mostly) lack of ego with everyone I work with... it's absolutely incredible. I've made close friends for life here; when some of them leave, they've all missed the culture and the people dearly.

The AB leadership team is incredibly competent and focused, but they should be way more communicative and proactive about getting in front of employees. I know they appreciate the huge sacrifices employees make for the company, but could do a TON more to actually show it, like socializing with us more and offering more interaction and visibility; also giving everyone access to a stock purchase program and not just handing out equity to the magical ""Directors and above"" cutoff.
