92,If you're going to work as an engineer on the post silicon side - beware.,2.0,"- Your experience depends on the team - you can get lucky and end up on a team that recognizes your efforts and respects work life balance. 
- Good office location - free parking and lots of restaurants near by.
- The paychecks clear.","If you're not lucky and end up on an overworked team, this is what your life will look like: 
- Low pay in comparison to other tech companies. On top of which, overtime and weekend work is the norm and there's no additional pay or time off. If you want to get some rest, which is what a weekend should be for, you will have to use your vacation time.
- The more senior employees are forced to and end up working on their vacation time as well. 
- Will not let you carry over any unused vacation time. Upper management will pick certain days of their choice when the entire company has to use their entitled vacation days. They will call this a 'recharge' day. Usually, you will end up working on these 'recharge' days too. 
- After working overtime till 8-9 pm, you will be expected to again work between 11 pm - 2 am to work with the AMD locations in a different time zone. Then you'll have to pick yourself up the next morning and start working again at 9:30 am. 
- Every once in a while you will have an 'easy week'. An easy week is 50 hours with minimal weekend work. This is very rare. 
- You will notice that the most successful people in overworked teams are usually single or divorced - this is because you will have no time to maintain any personal relationships. 
- Management knows employees are overworked and burnt out - yet will not acknowledge or do anything about it. Instead, they will add more projects, and crunch timelines even further without making any changes to address the original situation. 
- Everyone has a price but all of these cons are not worth for the low pay and low recognition you will get at the end of the day. Most engineers' base salaries are not even six figures.",4 people found this review helpful,2021-04-11, Senior Engineer ,Markham, ON,Current Employee, more than 3 years

--I'm not sure everyone realizes what a powerhouse Lisa Su is - she's a total badass and knows exactly what she's doing, and it's nice to have that kind of confidence in your CEO. 
--They also do a good job of moving around their top employees to do different things and get them promoted. 
--There is a lot of flexibility and autonomy - work from home (or wherever) is rarely an issue.","--The story of AMD is really compelling, but the workload can just be impossible. It's hard when you've worked so many long hours for so long to keep going sometimes. You'll rarely have a weekend off, and your vacation/holiday time isn't necessarily sacred either.
--They send mixed-messages on communicating to the executive team: they will say publicly that you can go to an executive and ask them a question, but when people actually do, executives often get offended.
--Salary and benefits are just okay, nothing to write home about. I know they try to keep an eye on what salary markets are doing, but their data gets so stale so quickly.
--As with any large company, things tend to happen slowly and you need like 8 layers of approval to get anything done.

992,Shooting itself on the foot,2.0,"-Like many reviews before point out, there is a good life-work balance. Be careful though because many individuals interpreted the very same thing in a more negative way (lack of ambition, schedules are rarely observed, ...). 

-There is a very positive consequence of not being a successful company: people tend to be more grounded than in other tech companies. The constant chaos results in workers that understand what the important things in life really are, and understand that most of them happen outside of the workplace.

-Strangely enough, you can get promoted fairly quickly (by elimination, everyone leaves but you), which may help out when you move to the next job","-The company is a mess. Upper management is there just to collect the $ and have no real intention to turn around the company (for starters, google ""AMD Rasgon bonuses"" and click on the Yahooo article)

-Employees are treated like idiots. We are promised a never-ending list of things that are oh-just-around-the-corner and never happen: more share in emerging markets, the emergence of a semi-custom business (fancy way to describe two game console wins), gaining market share back from NVIDIA (according to Lisa Su in 2014 ""there is no reason why AMD's graphics share should not be 50%"", it now stands below 30%), and so on. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me (and then I leave)

-Constant layoffs plus attrition = scarce engineering talent. It is very difficult for AMD to come up with good products considering the amount of good people who left, and the fact that they have been replaced by so-so engineers since top talent will land elsewhere

-Morale is low. The parking lot is almost empty by 6.30pm. You meet strangers and five minutes they are openly making fun of the company. The ex-CEO is laid off and given $5M in cash but people do not see any salary raise when they are promoted.

1149,Drastic Changes needed in order to survive (perspective of an ASIC engineer),2.0,"Opportunity to work on some really exciting cutting edge technology as well as learn and hone your skills. 

Current CEO genuinely cares about the company and is not just there to bide time before deploying the golden parachute. 

Current executives are starting to be aware of the problems (outlined in the two sections below) and may be able to turn the company around.","Non-existent raises and bonuses (not existent because of how poorly the company is currently performing). Huge discrepancy between people when it comes to responsibilities and compensation. You may be working like a dog and be responsible for a number of things, all while getting paid less than a person (same role and title, but different team) who is doing 20% of what you do while getting paid more. Frustrating lack of technical leadership. Most of the middle management really lacks technical skills which is unacceptable for an engineering company. (Many ASIC managers are not capable of any technical contribution and some lack understanding of some absolutely fundamental concepts). As a result, a lot of managers solve their problems by simply throwing more people at the issues. This empire building attitude creates large teams with a lot of weak engineers instead of lean, agile teams with strong engineers. During my past years with the company I have seen far more good people leave than join. A lot of groups have family (mafia) like relationships within them. While this may be a good thing because people have a lot of friends at the office, it does not promote a healthy, critical look at the teams (i.e. everyone is family; there are no strong or weak people). 

HR heavily influences promotion cycles which is highly demotivating and leads to a ""government job"" attitude at the workplace. Why work harder when you'll get your promotion anyways after x-number of years?

1217,AMD has one more shot...,2.0,"Engineering teams are always trying to do their best despite the internal politics, budget challenges, many layoffs, and cancelled/unsuccessful products.  It's admirable.","the old AMD (3-4 years ago) was successful because of it's great engineering talent and the sheer strength of will and pride the teams took in solving problems together to make things happen.  Things got done because terrific people made it happen.

Unfortunately, due to the decline in the PC market, and difficulty in implementing the strategy to grow in other segments, continual layoffs have drained the company of many of it's top engineers and fantastic ""boots on the ground"" managers, while insulating much of it's ""behind the front lines"" senior management, who continue to jockey for position/power/salary.  

Senior managers are able to get promoted by showing that they are aggressive in their goals and being able to beat up engineering and other teams, despite not having good decisions and strategy based on logic and analysis.  Somehow showing aggressiveness and a willingness to ""punish"" others and teams who don't deliver, you are seen as good management material vs. actually having innovative ideas and fostering collaboration and growth and driving mutual success.  It's sort of an old school way of thinking and doing business...where it's best to do what your told and not challenge those above you, and prove your worth/loyalty by making those below you do what your boss wants.  

Corporate culture keeps asking for engineers/teams to speak up, ask questions, come up with more ideas...while the real, internal culture silently tells you, you better stay quiet and just do what you're told.  It's like the executive team read about what does Google look like, and then focused on AMD ""looking"" like that too, without actually changing the culture from within...just merely trying to look like that from the outside.

AMD reminds me of a place, where perhaps a 100 years ago,  kerosene managers were fighting to climb the corporate ladder at their company, after Edison invented the lightbulb.  They were so focused on their own self interest and their political positions internally, that they lost sight of the real danger, and eventually became extinct.  For AMD there's not much time given the cash balance and burn rate, and the increased competition who have much larger budgets and engineering talent.",3 people found this review helpful,2015-05-31, Anonymous Employee ,Austin, TX,Current Employee,
1218,Opportunities and Instability,3.0,"1. AMD offers some very interesting work. Between ARM cores, x86 cores, and high-end graphics, AMD offers a variety of cutting-edge work that no other company can match. I have always been completely satisfied and stimulated with the work I have been given here. 
2. AMD is willing to give young engineers a great deal of responsibility, so one can grow quickly as an engineer here. This is a place where you feel that you can really make a difference. 
3. Although I think AMD's talent has degraded somewhat over recent years, there are still many talented and passionate engineers here from whom one can learn a great deal. 
4. The AMD executive team is fairly strong. Lisa Su in particular is exceedingly bright and well respected. 
5. AMD has all of the pieces in place to be a very successful company. With a lucky break here or there, it could become a very profitable company. 
6. AMD has an underdog culture that appeals to many.","1. AMD has been struggling mightily financially for about a decade now. There are frequent lay-offs and constant restructurings. This is not the place to work if stability is your primary desire in a job. 
2. Although AMD's pay and benefits are competitive, the company seldom makes money and thus generally doesn't pay out much in the way of bonuses or RSUs. Other companies can afford to be more generous here. 
3. AMD is contractually obligated to work with GlobalFoundaries, which has serious execution challenges that adversely impact AMD. It is frustrating to work so hard on a chip only to have the FAB not execute on it. 
4. AMD's teams are generally understaffed, so it is sometimes a challenge to maintain a good work/life balance. My balance is fine now, but it has been very poor on occasion.

The engineering team needs to better communicate concepts and strategies to each other and to new hires. There's a lot of people in their own world and like things done their own way, but this is unhealthy because if you don't collaborate and communicate then there are going to be different peoples' expectations that are at odds with each other. I don't think this is done intentionally though and most are courteous enough to take time to help you understand and open minded enough to change their minds if need be.

Not a lot of crazy pie-in-the-sky research projects -- everyone's work is directly related to products.

Some very senior bullshitters have built empires for themselves, and you don't want to cross them. Some parts of the company are an old-boy network, and some of the old boys don't hardly deserve their privilege.

Revolving door senior management. Revolving door strategic plans. Annual layoffs and titanic-deck-chair-rearranging exercise. There are big upcoming debt payments, so a major future restructuring seems unavoidable.

There's been brain drain, and less mature people have been promoted to fill the gaps, this has led to coworker quality issues on some teams. 

No accountability. Nobody ever gets in trouble for missing deadlines, low quality deliverables. It's good enough right?

AMD can be democratic in the worst way. We can't do something unless everyone agrees, but we have to keep talking about it if anyone wants to do it.

AMD laid off 7 percent of their workforce while the server group had a 17 percent layoff which tells a lot.

Engineering is horrible in being able to support sales.  We had to send engineers out to customers sites for weeks to get a system running.
They will try to sell you on how great their product is and how great they are doing, don't listen to them as it is all a sham.  They are struggling, have sub par engineering and do not have a clue on the server market.

1393,"Politics, Burn-out, Poor Management, No Real Engineering",1.0,"The salary is competitive for Canada.  You can pay your bills and provide for your family.  However, bonuses are almost non-existent, and RSU incentives are so overvalued to determine quantity that its comedic.

Many of the engineers are good, smart, hard-working people.  But this has nothing to do with AMD.  Many engineers in general are good, smart, hard-working people.  This comment is applicable to pretty much any company that has engineers!","After reading many reviews, it is apparent that experiences are quite varied in the company.  Here are the cons with platform development (board-level design):

1. No work-life balance for multiple reasons. (a)management will overload newer employees and allow Sr. Staff members to add to it. (b)Marketing will cancel projects after you have put in insane hours and then increase the quantity of SKUs without changing the deadlines =  More work expected in half the time.  No, your manager will not push back on your behalf.

2. Technical decisions are made by people who don't know.  Marketing wants something based on cost and an apples-oranges comparison with the competition, then it's up to the engineer to make it happen.  And no, the laws of physics are not considered an acceptable reason to why it can't be done.  
3. Career growth opportunities are extremely limited.  Those that exist are not given to the achievers, but rather the boss' friends.

4. POLITICS has killed Engineering! (a) Much of the hardware work is being shipped to China so everyone in platform is struggling to prove their value to the company; even if it means being treated like a doormat. (b) Senior Staff Engineers who have been promoted above their ability compensate by off-loading doomed-to-fail work and then pointing fingers when things don't work out. When a junior engineer succeeds, the senior guy will manage to pass off the success as his own. (c) You can never have an engineering discussion.  Any purely technical conversation is killed because it is above the heads of many (including the senior guys).  Mathematical explanations are disregarded unless you have experimental proof.  The experimental evidence may be physically impossible to obtain for any number of reasons, but that just means you are wrong. (d) The word ""ownership"" plagues the department to the point where it no longer has meaning.  You may ""own"" a design, but 3 of your colleagues have dictated what components you are to use, the PCB layer count, and thermal conditions so you have no room to design anything.  Your ownership has been reduced to schematic entry, and technician level testing.

5. Poor management.  Related to the point on politics, many managers are not qualified to lead their teams.  They are not as knowledgeable as  their reports.  The manager-employee relationship turns into a struggle and the employee will always lose with a disproportionate workload, no work-life balance, and poor performance reviews regardless of any significant contributions made to the company.",9 people found this review helpful,2014-07-30, Senior Design Engineer ,Markham, ON,Former Employee, more than 3 years

Yes, AMD's salaries are extremely competitive. Work/life balance is yours to own as long as you deliver. However, the real selling factor is the people: Colette LaForce is easily the most personable CMO I've had the pleasure of working for in my career. She is open to new ideas, critical feedback and in turn her leadership mostly mirrors these traits. The marketing team at AMD across the board is full of great leaders who are passionate and intelligent.

The organization I worked in is full of  go getters who work hard but, in my opinion, are ultimately under appreciated because of AMD's historical engineering and sales focus.","As the company is mid-turn around, there is some natural confusion and oftentimes bureaucracy.

* Many smart people, and almost all of them are willing to teach you what they know
* Very casual culture, engineers are generally approachable and friendly.  Dress code is non-existent.
* Technical ideas usually succeed on their merit - anyone can offer up a good idea and impact the product, no matter how junior
* Can-do attitude still exists, despite occasionally getting burned out
* Generous work from home policy and fairly flexible hours
* Flexible career path - managers are open and supportive of changing groups if you want to try another job (at least between verif/DFT/RTL/synthesis teams)
* Lower to mid level management all have engineering backgrounds and are technically competent
* Mid-to-senior level management has improved substantially on the engineering side - Jim Keller is an engineer's engineer which is great to have at an executive level","* Always challenging
* Workload can be very heavy at times, and additional compensation is rarely offered.  It is easy to burn out and largely your individual responsibility to manage your own workload and say when enough is enough
* Benefits are standard to sub-standard, have substantially declined during the no/negative-profit period and seem unlikely to improve any time soon, despite profitability
* Consistent low level attrition (this is maybe to be expected, as Austin has a very active market for chip designers)
* Cost cutting measures can make you feel like you're getting nickled and dimed to death sometimes
* It's not always clear what impact your work will make on the company's success until long after the fact.  Being highly self-motivated, enjoying a challenge, and being able to ignore high level distractions and just focus on the immediate project are requirements to work happily here - which is fine, as long as you fit that description.  If you don't, you may not enjoy it at all.
* Emotional stability is a requirement here.  You have to roll with the punches, including annual layoffs, and not get overly distracted or distraught.

AMD allows their employees the freedom to get the job done through flexible schedules and tele-commuting from home.  AMD provides many community outreach projects and activities to help promote bonds between employees.  A great place to start, then run.","Incentives such as  stock purchase, target bonuses have been reduced or eliminated.  Multiple influences from upper management promote mission creep, incomplete projects, and changing product line focus.

Project managers with their worthless PMP certificate run the show. Development morale is at an all time low. Developers don't give a flip about doing a good job, most of them have become desensitized because they constantly put out fires, and fix problems caused by bad planning and incompetent project management. They don't care about innovation. Innovative ideas are usually poorly executed, making the product WORSE.

Ideas don't come from developers and engineers, it comes from marketing. AMD always plays catch-up. AMD is an extremely poor jack of all trades. The only reason this company exists is because they sell cheap crap.

There is no prospect for advancement, if you start your job on the wrong team. AMD will never have swan stories of somebody who started in the mail-room (or the equivalent for an engineer), and worked his way up the chain and became successful. They hire ""experienced"" people from outside the company, and pay them 2x what somebody who's been with the company for 5 years makes. No internal promotions. You might get a title bump if your manager likes you, and you'll get more opportunities to tell other people how to do their jobs while checking your facebook.",5 people found this review helpful,2013-10-19, Software ,Markham, ON,Current Employee, more than 1 year

The company would consistently hire very senior level people, at very competitive salaries, and then assign them a title that would limit their potential for receiving any significant form of raise.  Most often the salary increases wouldn’t even cover increases in cost of living (not good for a long term career).  Often when referring people into he company we would inform them to only accept a position if the company agreed to change the title to a higher level, thus forcing them to be hired at the bottom of the salary range with room for salary increases.

The Information Technology teams were re-organized SIX TIMES from the beginning of 2010 to the latter half of 2012.  By the end the staff was “siloed” into groups based on very specific functions, and none of these groups communicated well. This made it impossible to complete any project.

The promotions are few and far between and seem to be heavily based on who senior management sees most, not necessarily who is doing a good job.  You boss also has to like you because it appears they need to burn political capital to get promotions for non-senior management noticed people.  Management lets you do your thing, but that means when the poop hits the fan you can get fried too.  They don't really know what you do or how involved or difficult it is.  Raises are small.

2003,"Innovative and friendly, but extremely process driven, conservative, and as a result, quite disorganized.",2.0,"AMD Markham had an amazing assortment of technical talent in all positions. All engineers I found myself interacting with were extremely competent, and for the most part, quite friendly. My co-workers were usually happy to answer any questions I had regarding their area of expertise. As a result I received some very good advice in regard to design methodology, which was not properly covered during my University education.

Individual teams were all focused and dedicated to their tasks. There was seldom any confusion regarding the purpose of a team, or the results that were expected of them. Intra-team politics were generally quite low key, and  were seldom more serious than personality conflicts among incompatible team members. Fortunately management was able to contain even those such that team productivity did not suffer.

I also very much enjoyed the large amount of personal freedom given to employees. Work hours were not very strict, and the engineers were free to come and go as needed; it was not uncommon to see and impromptu tech discussions develop over coffee. Management would generally adopt a hands-off approach, only micro-managing during crunch times, which were thankfully quite short. Team-wide meetings were also a very positive and friendly experience for everyone involved.","Unfortunately, AMD is quite old for a tech company, and it shows. To make matters worse, the AMD and ATI merger was not nearly as smooth as it could have been, resulting in a lot of conflicting processes and incompatible data organization styles. Also, while most technical personnel were very reasonable and professional, there were some people in very high positions that let the seniority really go to their head.

AMD has been operational for over 40 years, while ATI has been going for 25 years, only 5 of which were as part of AMD. During this time both of these companies saw momentous shifts in technology, and in many cases were right at the center of these shifts. Over such a long time a lot of processes are developed to address a huge range of problems that inevitably arise during operation. Unfortunately, being on the leading wave of technology means that most of these processes could not take advantage of the innovations they help to implement. 

Once a company of this size defines a number of new processes, standard corporate mentality takes over and the short-term cost of optimizing these processes becomes very difficult to justify on the balance sheets. The result is that these decisions can easily live on for decades, until replacing them becomes an emergency concern, with all of the associated headaches, rushed specifications, and buggy implementations. Of course the existence of competing standards defined within the scope of ATI before it was acquired effectively doubles the number of stakeholders, and makes the problem not only more challenging, but also more pressing.

Also as a result of the age of these companies, relevant information is extremely hard to find. The company wide search is about as advanced as a search engine of the mid 1990s, and will only respond to some very creative search term voodoo. Often times the only way to get some information is to ask someone familiar with the topic where to find the data you are looking for. This is not a difficult task when you can ask a team member, but becomes exponentially harder the further away you have to look. 

Finally, while most personnel, both technical and management, are very helpful and professional, there are a few people in senior positions that are quite the opposite. Over the years, certain people have managed to take control of very large and important projects, and now make working in these project domains extremely difficult. Often these situations are a result of personal or cultural problems, but the resulting political dancing necessary to fix even the smallest issue is daunting for an engineer without a political background; this includes most of those on a non-management track.",3 people found this review helpful,2011-05-14, Engineer I ,Markham, ON,Former Employee,

Also, often there isn't enough time to think through things and actually acquire understanding because of the rush to get stuff done and move on to the next task.

Many of the managers in the company do not have any business experience and instead come from a purely technical background, and thus lack essential skills in employee engagement and motivation.

2025,A frustrating disappointment,2.0,"AMD has less nonsense time wasters from upper management than a company such as Intel. For example, less required ""training"" in subjects such as 'business ethics', 'sexual harassment', and 'soldering safety'. AMD has less of the ""too secret to show you"" people than Intel.","AMD has too many non-technical managers. Surprisingly enough, engineering is fairly important at a microprocessor design company. How can a manager who is technically incompetent do a good job managing engineers? The result is promotions for those engineers with unusual skill in powerpoint, fast talking and hand waving, or who speak with an unusual accent.

AMD has way too many project managers, at least in some areas. These non-technical people ""manage"" highly technical projects by constantly asking about the schedule, rather than solving project logistic or hardware problems.

An engineer who has good powerpoint and hand waving skills will be happy here. However if you believe actual results are more important than talk, you will be frustrated at AMD.

Advice for interviewing: It is very easy to impress the non-technical managers, if you can do it with a straight face. Just use as many of these phrases as possible when speaking:

move forward
going forward
enablement
traction
driving towards
all on the same page
We aren’t where we want to be
close the loop
stay tuned

2213,Welcome to Dilbert World,2.0,"AMD is constantly looking for new ways to compete with Intel.  It is this rivalry that pushes innovation and product quality, pushing everyone to think creatively about how to do more with much less resources than Intel.  AMD is extremely family friendly.  All of my managers supported taking time off for family or health reasons, and though the culture is to push through it, this is considered to be above and beyond expectations.  

Working from home is perfectly acceptable, and everyone assumes you're reachable on your company-provided cell phone if you're out of the office.","Since the departure of founder Jerry Sanders, AMD has been wandering aimlessly for the next innovation.  Customer satisfaction is important at the time of sale and after the sale, but no/little thought is given to what the customer will want when the products are being designed.  The term ""customer-centric innovation"" that Hector Ruiz pushed for so many years has nothing to do with innovation around the product (AMD acquires companies with good ideas, it does not have an R&D of its own).  Even after the sale, software that supports the product is a necessary expenditure that is minimized.  AMD has lost its crown as the leading processor innovator and speed king, and has never understood that it has a role in developing hardware+software solutions that will create demand for processor products.

Though it is possible to be promoted to team lead or manager with enough effort, director and above titled open positions are almost always filled from the outside by someone with experience working with that title.  Despite all of the HR promises about reviewing the skill set of employees, continuing education to develop the skills of employees, and the value placed on employees' work, AMD does not value its employees and treats them as a necessary expenditure:
* Medical benefits are structured to minimize costs to providers and waste as much of the employee's time as possible (e.g. blood tests can not be performed in any doctor's office, and the insurance company will have the employee paying a significant percentage of the costs).
* IT continuously seeks excuses not to fix your equipment.  
* Sabbticals are a privilege, not a right, and may be postponed as long as it takes to achieve profitability but non-profitability does not affect executives' bonuses.  
* Administrators are for department directors and above.  Everyone is expected to:
  - book their own travel
  - fill out their own expense reports
  - look through the catalog of office supplies, though the director's admin will obtain director's approval to buy office supplies.
* Coffee and tea are free but vending machines and cafeteria are expensive.  
* If you're there long enough, their outsourced employee recognition vendor may send you a catalog of AMD-logoed junk to select from (for 5 years of service, I picked the watch with gold trim which came with a note warning that it is not water resistent).  

Directors and above have certain privileges that make working harder (to get the coveted rank) desirable... until you understand that directors are hired from the outside.  The concept of ""management by walking around"" is completely foreign in this culture.  Instead, AMD has a culture of maximizing required approvals, forms, and meetings for Managers, Directors and the various Vice President ranks (VP, Corporate VP, Senior VP, Executive VP) segregating managers from their direct reports.  Executives are members of an elite club with special privileges including access to the corporate jet, access to in-house IT, and exclusive meeting rooms.

2215,Fun place to work but not financially rewarding due to company's current financial woes (Feb 2009).,4.0,"One of the best reasons to work at AMD is the people and the core projects.  AMD is developing cutting edge CPU and GPU products that are very competitive in the market place.  You will work with some very smart people and have a good time doing so.  Its nice when a project you worked so hard on makes it into the hands of millions of people and you know you played a part in the success.  However, thats about where it ends.

AMD is going through some very tough times financially where some of it is due to bad economic times, lack of execution on some key CPU products, and the acquisition of ATI.  Due to this employees are hit with cut-backs such as 10% salary cuts, no promotions, bonuses, etc.  These are temporary and many successful companies have gone through these kinds of cut-backs including Intel.  However, the senior leadership seems to be making some good choices about how to manage this.  For example, they are executing very well on an initiative called Asset Lite and have been selling off non-core businesses and have started a new company to run the fabs.  These initiatives are helping to reduce the overall debt and keep more people with jobs.","AMD is not doing well financially and this trickles down to the employees such as 10% salary cuts, no match on 401k, etc.  Also, the health care benefits suck.",1 person found this review helpful,2009-02-26, Senior Member of Technical Staff ,Marlborough, MA,Current Employee,

Furthermore, AMD is accommodates your personal life by providing flex hours and work-from-home opportunities.
3. Techie Incentives- if you have interest in the high tech industry, employee purchase plans provide significant discounts on the newest toys.  Furthermore, the latest and greatest items are available to observe and test- very exciting for a tech enthusiast.","There are perspectives to this answer.

Some (but few) managers are great about promoting employee successes.,Lack of direction from senior management plus the continuous re-org's and layoffs - it makes for a very unmotivating and uncertain working environment. Most employees are hoping for a layoff package vs hoping to stay. Current manager claimed disappointment of assigned team (resulting from re-org) and said he was given a junior team; this junior team has 10-18 years of experience. Don't expect significant salary increases for sticking around the company for many years - it's best to leave and get a significant jump rather than the standard 5-6 %.,Be the first to find this review helpful,2008-06-29, Marketing Manager ,Austin, TX,Current Employee,

It is perfectly acceptible to work from home for a few hours in the morning, commute into the office while the traffic is low and come home at a reasonable hour.  Or if your child gets sick, no problem, you don't need to take a sick day or vacation, you can just work from home.  If you don't get everything done that day, just work from home a couple hours in the evening to make up for it.  The point it that the hours are flexible.

That said, there is typically a review every year with a raise based on your performance 0-5%.  Although those raises have been delayed for most people due to low profitability this year.

No one is willing to stop what they're doing to focus on more important issues.  What's more, the management is structured to prevent you from doing anything of the sort.  AMD also puts as much burden of policies and paperwork on Manager level and below as they can so as to relieve the stress on upper ranks.  AMD is bleeding money in lost productivity among the individual contributors and is blissfully ignorant as to the cost of lost productivity from this approach.",Be the first to find this review helpful,2008-06-18, Software Relations ,Sunnyvale, CA,Former Employee,
