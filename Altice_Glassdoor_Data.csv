115,Employment uncertainty and aggressive Offshoring of Jobs,1.0,Altice mindset is to do 8 hours and go home.,"Every year a Voluntary Retirement Package is offered. If you do not take it, you are more like to end up losing your job. There's a massive layoff happening from both companies that make up AlticeUSA (Cablevision and Sudden Link). A lot of jobs, are now offshore, meaning out of the country mainly in India. And there is a lot of consultants hired by Tata (an India company) to replace full time employees. Employee benefits shrunk where an employee account was once $21 per month. Now it is approx. $100 a month once the take over took place.  AlticeUSA doesn't like to do business with US companies unless they can get up to 80% off of the cost of doing business. So the products they sell are all foreign. The culture is cut throat. There's no longevity as Americans are being replaced with other personnel from other countries. And ironically, they (foreigners) are getting pay just as much as a Full Time employees from the US. Be careful of the information you give the company. There was an e-mail shared among top execs that was compromised that had employee information such as social security numbers, date of birth, name address and etc that can be used for scam artist to open credit card accounts under your name. And the only recourse the company is doing is paying one year credit monitoring service. After that, we are on our own. For a huge mistake they done. Also, bonus structure is completely unfair. If the division you work for does good, you get a bonus accordingly. If not, well you get nothing. Sadly, executives report to investors the company is doing great. However, they tell the employees the opposite so not to pay out. Check out 2019 financials and news report for yourself. Bottom line is that they are keeping a minimum amount of US employees to satisfy all governments in their foot print. As well as making it uncomfortable to stay and work for them. Most of the executive lives in the Upper East side of Manhattan with Pent Houses worth over $20 million. So they need to support their life style while paying back a huge debt back to investors. Do not think you have a career here. Your hired for  specific time frame and then let go. I know you want the job, but think very cautiously. The crab in the bottom of the barrel is in full affect.

Long time employees are encouraged to leave the company by offering retirement packages every couple years and positions are either eliminated or back-filled with less experienced and cheaper talent. Teams are split between vast areas with little communication between them, which negatively impacts projects and team performance. The teams don't have to be clustered together to work, but they need better communication with the managers. The managers shouldn't limit their interactions to the team members that happen to be local to them.  In the two months leading up to my departure, I had 2 conversations initiated by my manager, and 17 out of 20 team meetings canceled. I'm sure it was much worse, but the short email retention implemented by IT prevented me from looking back any further than that.

Free thinking is not allowed, everybody is expected and encouraged to follow orders blindly, even if they hurt the business. Random and haphazard decisions are made on a daily basis that are due to the focus of the current conference call they are on, and once a new demand comes down, everything else is forgotten. 
The ambition is crushed in people, the message across the board is “do not expect to get paid what you deserve, more work for less pay moving forward, and if you don’t like it we will hire 2 people to do the job as well as you for half the pay”. 
They took this place from a world class environment, to pretty much a socialist company, where everybody will get paid almost the same, regardless of numbers, efforts, experience, metrics, KPIs and knowledge, and that defeats the purpose of working in sales. 
They create stress out of nothing, and due to their personal conflicts, and looking for ways to cut cost, they change even the world class softwares we used, to a mom and pop patchy software that does nothing it’s supposed to be doing.

210,Cesspool of mediocrity.,1.0,Altice offers decent healthcare benefits.,"What negative thing can’t you say about this company? Out of all my professional experience, working with Altice was the biggest mistake of my career. To start, after Cablevision was sold, things started to progress from pretty high spirits, to the bottomless pit of despair. 

It started when Altice came in and gutted as many experienced and knowledgeable employees to cut costs for their inevitable IPO. Cablevision’s field service workforce was pretty much left to dry as Altice Technical Services became a separate company and essentially forced people to take lower pay and worse benefits or find a new job. This impacted customer service by having to use an army of undertrained and useless contractors that created a gaping hemorrhage of customers.

After not having the proper support for a network as substantial as Optimum, Altice continued to lower the quality of customer service reps. Hiring people for lower than market rate, not properly training them, outsourcing call centers to the Dominican Republic and South Africa, the list really could go on and on. They are now creating unrealistic retail stores with no advertising or marketing, spending boatloads of money on a new wireless service that is supposed to “compete” with the big 4. These stores are essentially converted walk in centers where people used to trade hardware and pay their bill. 

I could keep going on and on but there really is no point. This company used to be a great place to work, with livable wages, great atmosphere and intelligent employees. Now it has become the place where dreams go to die and it only looks as if things will get worse.

Since Suddenlink was bought out by Altice, there has been a dramatic change.  Employees are now being micromanaged as never before.  The company has laid-off many and even closed two of their call centers.

The training provided is sub-par.  There are a few good people left, but I highly doubt they will stay much longer as the company is adding more responsiblities and not paying any extra money.

No department will help another and there is zero accountability when they have to help but don't. One VP, of the five or six attached to every project, can derail a whole project by just not cooperating. Millions are waisted on started projects that will never see the light of day because of lack of cooperation.

This leads into the bureaucracy. Lets start with an example: a current customer impacting production bug cannot be fixed, despite having the changes tested and ready, because a VP must sign off. Our motto is take risks and fail fast, but no one adheres to this policy. We are exactly the opposite and upper management doesn't seem to see the irony. While competitors are building faster delivery pipelines, able to delivery changes in min instead of hours, we are going the other direction. We are adding more processes and manual oversight, moving from days to months for delivery timelines.

This brings me to the outsourcing. We have outsourced a huge chunk of our mission critical infrastructure to a company that doesn't know how to do software development. Again, our corporate policy is to retain talent, yet because of the massive layoffs, most talent has willing found new employment.

267,Senior Engineer,1.0,Free(ish) Cable. 4% 401k match. Bonus structure includes most/all employees.,"Morale continues to drop 2-3 years after Altice purchased Suddenlink and Cablevision. Nobody feels their job is secure here. Upper management has specifically stated that vacated technical positions will not be back filled, and in the last 2 years I have seen less than 10% of positions filled after being vacated. Teams are getting smaller and duties increased. As entire teams are laid off or the members find more secure employment, their duties are shifted to other teams that are already over tasked.  

Bonuses are based on unrealistic and arbitrary metrics, most of which are completely out of your control. Altice exceeded this years expectations by analysts, which the CEO brags about on social media and at company meetings, yet we are still short of our own expectations, so bonuses will reflect the miss. The goals and expectations are designed to be missed.

Yearly reviews are based on goals that are ambiguous at best, and often not the responsibility of your department. They somehow trickle down from upper management and get assigned to seemingly random departments. If your department was responsible for roadways, you might be expected to dredge a river, for example.

Being fast is more important than doing the job right. They won't admit that but if you want to keep your job you need to learn how to make things work with what you have. 
 
Communication is one way - theirs. Your input is not wanted. If you don't like that you can leave. 
  
Training has been butchered and, for some departments, additional training opportunities no longer exist.  

Outsourcing. Altice prefers to use contractors because it is cheaper than hiring and investing in in-house employees. 

As an employee you will soon learn that your place in the company is at the bottom.  And you will be expected to solve customer issues with limited or inferior resources.

299,Technical Support Representive,1.0,Before it was sold this would be full of things. I have 0 things to say good about it now.,"5+ years and I have never seen something change so drastically. Just from the representive side there is no care for the employee. The care is for the bottom line. The position use to start at $21 an hour. Now it starts at $18. The training is an embarrassment. In the Dolan days training was a few weeks one product and skill at a time. More knowledge based and created to assist the customer. The training now is done in the matter of 3 weeks where you need to learn, billing, internet, tv, phone, internet, business class, altice one equipment, legacy cable boxes, modems, and routers. It relies heavily on automated ""tools"" rather than supplying the rep with the proper knowledge regarding the product so they can develop customer support that says ""we care about our customers"". Extremely numbers driven. They have unrealistic goals for reps to handle each call and still attempt to provide some sort of reliable support. One fun KPI that was add for tech support is ""sales"". You now are required to sell as well or it can negatively affect your review. The scheduling is awful. It changes every 6 to 8 months, with no regards to the employees and the outside of work lives they have, like having children, college, or anything else. It's not fair to us. Altice isn't our life. There is no support for us on the floor. The lead line is always closed, and that's our next level of technical support for us! The supervisors are either hired out of the company, or are customer service sups moved to tech support. They dont have the technical knowledge needed to support reps when a higher level of technical support is needed. They broke down the optimum billing and tv department and merged tech support and them together, so now everyone has to learn skills quickly they weren't trained for. This way they save money on having multiple departments with more reps specificly trained in the skill for that department, but instead they can cut out reps by multi skill ""training"" less reps for the same amount of calls, and use call centers in George, Florida, and South Africa to do strictly billing and tv, because it's cheaper to do these jobs there. Health insurance out of pay check cost has increased a total of 300% from the previous year. When it was Cablevision, under 50k a year before overtime health insurance was free. Once over 50k the price goes to a small amount. $23 a month. Under Altice a single person policy for a new employee making under 50k a year for the $900 deductible United Healthcare plan is roughly $120 - $130 a month with $40 copay drs/$80 specialist, when the previous $900 deductible plan through United Healthcare, with the exact same coverages, cost the employee around $43 a month with $25 copay drs/ $40 specialist. This is how cheap the company is. There was a 6 month period where they stopped supply the cafeterias with plastic ware. There is no employee relations with human resources anymore. Trying to get an answer from them, gets you sent to the hr support desk instead. If you need a job, work here. Regarding customers, the premature lunch of faulty equipment even after beta tested has left our customers with a bad taste in their mouths, and it's called altice one. The fees and pricing of services continue to increase. Sports tv and broad cast TV surcharges in 2016 were combined and equaled $5.96. Modems (Arris 1602, 822/802, 804, Cisco dpq3925, Motorola sbv6220, plus unmentioned ones)were free or 4.95 rental fee, and cable boxes(Scientific Atlanta 4200, 4200hd, 4250hd, 8300, 8300hd and Samsung 5320) were $8 rental fee. Now the broadcast tv and sports tv surcharges will be $8.97 and $5.99 respectively. That's $9 in surcharge increases, 2nd of 2018 alone where it rose from a total of $5 this year. Equipment rental fees are at $10 for modems and $11 for cableboxes, all of which is old equipment that has not had any investment into it. Raising rental fees on old equipment to get whatever you can from the customer. Broadcast basic sent up from $17.99 to $19.99 at end of 2017 and is now going up to $24.99 with new increase in availability of channels for the package. If you have a chance to look, look elsewhere.

322,Perhaps the worst company you can possibly work for,1.0,"There is very little to be positive about this company.  The only positive is if you are a long time cable person, you are here probably making decent money.  Of course, the downside is they are actively looking to push you out the door and it very unlikely your skills translate outside the cable industry.","Where do you start?  
Altice USA really puts no value on any employee.  They don't care, they don't even pretend to care.  They are good at one thing, reducing costs.  What that means to you is no paper towels in the bathroom, some times you will have toilet paper,  no office supplies, and now they even took away the garbage pails at everyone's desk so they don't have to pay someone to empty them.  Yes, this is all true.  Very hard to believe, but all true.  The other thing I will say is you often read negative reviews about various companies... but one thing I can assure is everything you read about this one is true.  It is that bad.

Specifically in the marketing department. Senior leaders have no idea what is actually going on in the department, or if they do they don't care. They started by increasing the work day by an hour, with no increase in salary, and then they moved employees (majority of which live on long island) to work in Long Island City.  There was zero communication to employees in marketing of when exactly we would be moving, where we would be sitting, and zero care for how this move would impact our lives.  This resulted in many of the top performers leaving the company and none of their positions were filled. When i left the company there were 12 people left in marketing, doing all of the Optimum and Suddenlink marketing, for the 4th largest cable company in the US.  The creative team was shoved in basically a closet and had to assemble their desks themselves.  There is also little to no growth opportunities.  They would rather let top performers leave the company and rehire new people than promote them and provide them with a career path.

340,Altice (AUSA/ATS) / Suddenlink,1.0,"(Mostly) Free service, good benefits, company vehicle and cell phone, (mostly) independent work","Policies are made by a management team that seems to never have worked in field.

The company can never keep a deadline.

Laid off a large number of employees and consolidated dispatching centers. At one point the average hold time was 30 minutes - 1 hour for a technician to reach a dispatcher. Routing has been centralized in North Carolina and it takes a minimum of 15-20 minutes to reach a member of that group to have changes made to your work route. We were assured that with all of these changes and issues that PPH (points per hour) would not be held against us on our yearly scorecard for the yearly merit raises... they were of course and several employees were placed on corrective action plans because of it.

The splitting up of the company into two separate companies (Altice USA and Altice Technical Services) has created a tense “That’s not my problem” attitude between departments. 

Trouble call durations are now limited to 40 minutes or you face reprimand, corrective action plan, etc... to accommodate this the Last Tech Out procedures were changed; this was touted as a MAJOR accomplishment... then the change was reversed.

Since Altice purchased Suddenlink there has been a major atrophy of employees, with the technical department losing 2/3s of their former staff. 99% of those that left, did so voluntarily. Many of these employees had been with Suddenlink for 5-10 years and some of them as long as 35-40 years.

Suddenlink was a great company to work for. Altice is nothing more than a shell of what once was.

345,Welfare cable,1.0,"Honestly, there are not many pros left since Altice took over Cablevision 2 years ago.  Despite their promises to not change anything, there have been numerous changes throughout the company.  Health and dental insurance used to be free but no more.  The product benefit has remained relatively the same, with almost free Optimum Gold TV (plus all International packages and Playboy), Internet and Voice services.   Free life insurance which has been halved in terms of coverage amount.  Free employee assistance program which provides for several complimentary counseling sessions every year, and trust me it's needed with these horrible customers.","Customer service has pretty much been outsourced to inadequately trained work-at-home reps and a call center in the Dominican Republic.  Upper management expects reps to do more on every call, like pushing unnecessary upgrades and offering self-help options, while at the same time harassing agents via Skype if they're on a call for more than 20 minutes but with barely any available supervisors or leads to assist.  Field techs call out on every holiday, leaving customers and customer service to hang high and dry.  Techs flat out lie about visiting customer's homes, and use photos from Google Maps to ""prove"" that they were there.  Paid holidays have decreased.  Holiday bonuses have been eliminated.  The Altice One box and service are not ready for prime-time use, yet the company pushes it like there's no tomorrow.  Reps are expected to time their bathroom breaks and are penalized (or written up) for using personal time to do so, making the call centers pretty much American sweatshops.  No college education required any longer to be hired, which shows in how the new reps conduct and present themselves.  I've seen reps come in flip-flops and shorts, leave trash all over the break rooms, and even forget to flush after using the toilet.  No credit check when signing up customers, which leads to many delinquent accounts and unsavory conversations over billing ""issues"" over the phone.  No one should have to spend 20-30 minutes arguing over the phone with a supposed adult over how when you pay only half of your bill you're still going to owe the other half at some point soon.  Or when all of the networks decide to do the right thing and participate in a cancer charity event, you have the audacity to call in and curse out a rep because you can't watch your precious little TV programs.",5 people found this review helpful,2018-05-28, Customer Service Representative ,Newark, NJ,Former Employee, more than 1 year

They have no true care or concern for their employees. They put on an act as if they do in words but in action it does not line up. They do not believe in career pathing or developing. The only objective is to meet certain scores and make as much money as possible at the expense of their employees and customers. They do not pay their venders on time and double charge for benefits. The turn over rate is so high, they literally hire anyone off the streets who don’t care about morale, ethics or,professionalism. The bathrooms are disgusting; Urine on the walls in the men’s bathroom, there may be hand soap to wash your hands and paper towels to dry your hands; the floors are so dirty, when you walk, your shoes stick to the floor. Coffee stations are filthy and are not stocked. Facilities have taken a drastic decline. The floor are not vacuumed       Leadership no longer cares about it’s people or customer. This is all due to that Ungodly French company called Altice. They have ruined Suddenlink’s fine name and reputation. Altice has the audacity to use old suddenlink commercial with past employees who look so happy and readily would promote the company. I guarantee you none of those employees work for Suddenlink anymore and would never stand by the Altice way. In fact, Altice should get some present employees and do a commercial. I promise you, they will not look happy. In fact it might remind you of a commercial with sad orphan kids in Russia that need money for food and water. MARK MY WORDS.

It makes it easier to get into different departments without having any formal education or expertise in those areas. The company is open to individuals and not focused on actual skill sets. I am paid really well and the company treats me great. I know I am overpaid for the job but that is because I knew the folks before hand and we were friends. I also like the company for ignoring my previous criminal records and poor performance. Most companies would not hire me but this company does.,I have to read my customers e-mails and review their internet history daily. I have to write reports on my region and their customers and their browsing history. I have to share this for marketing purposes to generate extra revenue. I am not sure if that is a good thing for the customers. That is the only downside for working for this company.,2 people found this review helpful,2017-06-13, Senior Director ,New York, NY,Current Employee, less than 1 year

We have lost seasoned reps because of the financial hardship that Altice has inflicted on families.  There's days that guys can't work due to no gas $.  We are to work more for less pay.  Management has informed us today that ""We didn't have time to add bonuses to the now monthly commissions pay(that was bi-weekly) this month so it should be on the next check"".  They didn't have TIME?  Seriously?  Don't trust that we will even get the bonuses, ever!  Management says that they are working to fix the pay problem, to hang with it!  Lol!  Wait until we are evicted?  People have negative checks already-that's another story.  Just don't work here if you need the income.  If you can afford to lose everything, this is the right fit for you.  Don't believe management. They don't know anything.

695,Great until the Altice buy out. Now cost/profit is primary motivator. No more employee centric anything.,2.0,Excellent starting & earnings potential and benefits. No real growth potential beyond call center Supervisor.,"Frequent shift bids without any regard for tenure. Constantly changing performance metrics absent of any dispute process.   No training or up training of any value. Every minute of every day accounted for via computer based time clock with swift and often job ending corrective actions for minor deviations. A definite ""what have you done for me lately"" and ""the door swings both ways"" attitude without any consideration for senior employees. Anyone on FMLA or medical leave is painted with a large red target by HR for any reason to terminate with extreme prejudice.",Be the first to find this review helpful,2016-08-11, Technical Support Representative III ,Shelton, CT,Current Employee, more than 10 years

Benefits were great they even gave you free Cable, Internet & TV with every channel and fastest internet. Very flexible hours once I got used to it I was working about 25 hours a week (because I was always meeting quota which is very low.)",I worked there when it was owned b Cablevision but it is now Altice so they have made some changes. From what I heard the pay stayed the same but they track you to make sure your working randomly.,1 person found this review helpful,2016-07-30, Account Manager ,Wall, NJ,Former Employee,
