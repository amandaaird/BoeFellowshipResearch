58,"Okay semiconductor company in Philippines, but not the best.",3.0,"Allegro Microsystems Philippines Inc., or AMPI in short, has been around in the Philippines since the 1970s and has been the company's lone assembly and test site until the opening of AMTC or Allegro Thailand last May 2015. As for the pros:

- provides the benefits that most semicon companies in the Philippines offers, like rice subsidy, yearly bonus, meal allowance, shuttle, hmo, paid leaves, retirement plan,incremental yearly increase. also provides the govt mandated benefits like OT pay, night differential, 13th month pay
- good working environment, nice people. not selfish in sharing knowledge and skills
- good working and learning experience for fresh graduates
- provides inhouse trainings and seminars
- for shifting personnel, the work schedule is 5 working days and 2 leaves for 12 hours. Looking at a positive perspective, this is good for those who want to earn more.
- recently, management has been very aggressive in raising the standards of the company through leaner manufacturing, fast paced product innovation, organizational restructuring and updating old and dated systems to be more competitive

In summary, AMPI is a very good training and starting ground for technicians and engineers alike who would want to specialize in a multinational semiconductor industry. The compensation is more or less just right for those who have 3 years or less of working experience, plus the environment is good and not stress-filled.","As I have been with two other multinational semiconductor companies who can be considered as more or less a direct competitor to AMPI for a short time, I have noticed the ff:

- benefits that are being offered in AMPI are far LESS than what they are offering in other top semiconductor companies in Philippines. In some cases, bonuses and subsidies are two times less here vs. others. Allowances and paid leaves of other semicon companies are also better than AMPI. Yearly increase are also so small it is almost negligible
- trainings, despite being good, leaves a lot to be desired
- lunch hours are not paid. non shifting personnel are are required to be at the office for 52.5 hours a week or roughly 10.5 hours per day
- for shifting personnel, the work schedule is 5 working days and 2 leaves for 12 hours. Looking at a negative perspective, this schedule can prove to be quite exhausting. Some companies follow a 4 working day, 3leave schedule with no personnel working for more than 60 hours per week - something that AMPI does not provide.
- internal job opportunities is so limited that there is only a small room for professional growth here
- despite the management efforts to transform the company into a competitive one, I believe that the road is still a long and winding one partly due to the Herculean task of tearing down the old ways of thinking that wass ingrained in the company for a long time. I doubt that it will ever become the best in its class here

In summary, if you are a potential employee with 3 years or more of working experience in the semiconductor industry, you may find the compensation package and the opportunities for growth here to be a bit below what is expected, although you may want to consider this company if you are applying for an exempt position.",1 person found this review helpful,2015-06-29, Engineer ,Manila," Manila, Manila",Current Employee, more than 1 year

65,Great company for work-life balance,4.0,"I have worked in the NH design center:
1) Hours aren't as intense as in competitors. You are asked to work harder during peak periods, but in general pace is a tad slower.
2) When things go wrong, projects get delayed, company asks how it can help you rather than beat you over the head.
3) Company isn't public, nor bleeding edge, so attracting talent is difficult. If you are talented, the company will do everything it can to retain you.
4) Although this is group dependent, I found the people working there very personable and friendly.
5) Great place to learn out of school or if you consider yourself ""hot-stuff"" and want an opportunity to lead.","1) Not a public company, not working on bleeding edge. 
2) Main customers are Japanese automotive manufacturers which are very demanding and scrutinize everything but the organization isn't sized correctly to meet all their demands. 
3) As in every company of this size, internal politics exist in the upper management. Not the worst I've seen, but if you're not in a core group or politically aligned group, can be frustrating.
4) Company in general is reactive (and they do it very well) rather than proactive. You need to get a counter offer/threaten to leave to get good promotion or retention perks. However, if you do and you are considered talent, they are very aggressive about it.
5) Their product definers are weak: they usually chase existing sockets rather than attack new ones. Rely on Field Apps for definitions rather than have separate product definers as in some competitors.",3 people found this review helpful,2014-10-06, Engineer ,Manchester, NH,Former Employee,
