The CEO tried and failed to to convince the company he cares about DE&I. Company wide meetings addressing a racist c-level exec who was was fired within two weeks were a train wreck.

* Interesting code base","* Poor career development opportunities in engineering. There is a definite ""in crowd"" at the top of the engineering hierarchy and projects are staffed based on their opinions
* Promotions are blatantly about who you know and how important your project is to product management, and not about contributions, skill, experience, or competence. ""Standards"" are bent or ignored frequently to promote some people while the goal posts are continually moved for others (often while still adding more and greater responsibility)
* Engineering leadership has no clue where they are going from month to month. Strategies change often and there are multiple silos unknowingly working against each other because the different areas don't coordinate. Other times, office politics cause them to deliberately work against each other to impress the CTO
* Engineering middle management is mostly useless. They are there to collect paychecks and make the CTO happy. A few are excellent and carry the load. Most teams are run by the senior and lead engineers. Managers and directors tend to fail upwards

38,This was an amazing company but everything changed...,1.0,"- Great product (although it has not been significantly improved for many years)
- Salary is above average but this should be a warning sign for candidates (see below)","- Point solution and nowhere near a real analytics 'platform' (or cloud solution). I am wondering why no large cloud company just copied what Alteryx does and their competitive advantage is getting smaller and smaller. Move to the cloud has been announced in 2016 but was never accomplished.

- Culture and people were amazing but with the new CEO everything changed. He hired one of his 'old buddies' as CRO (Dean Darwin) and had to kick him out after 2 months due to racist comments he made on LinkedIn. Although they are friends for many years (announced when Darwin joined), he later denied knowing any of Darwin's 'views' and nobody questioned this behaviour.

-Turnover is incredible and the management teams (C-level to first line) was kicked out and replaced almost 80%. Now the company is led by people that are mainly 50+ and all joined in the last 8 months. Many do not care about the product and even less about people. People get kicked out although 50% of positions are open and many leave the organization due to the complete ignorance of new leadership. No one tries to really understand the product or listens to experienced managers and is pushing their old school sales tactics down the throats of those who remained. This leads to even more problems and more pressure for pipeline / revenue.

- If you want to get micromanaged, this is your company. While open communication about problems and issues get ignored, they push you to work on call lists with superficial messaging like it's a 1990 insurance sales call center. 

- no support. You cannot count on any support from a business development organization (open headcounts but no new hires in months). You'll need to participate in pipe gen 'cold call' days and all pipeline issues land on your back. SE team is great but also slightly understaffed.

-They are hiring everyone from everywhere due the incredible turnover. Currently 1/3 of sales positions globally are open and this aggressive hiring comes at a price. Since the managers don't understand product, processes and do not care about people, everybody is frustrated. No real onboarding in regional offices makes this worse. The atmosphere is quite toxic.

-Promotion potential within your specialty","I started several months before the company went public at the Broomfield office. The culture was the best I've ever experienced anywhere. Post IPO, the tale-as-old-as-time chipping away at what made the company great began.
-Employees became the least valued commodity
-Empty diversity gestures and programming
-Every single product decision is based on short term bullets for investors 
-Yes men/women were installed as middle managers as we grew operations; very much their way or the highway - zero top cover from the other yes leaders
-Team bonding lunches were axed (new hires, promotions, birthday months)
-Pre-Covid catering fell off a cliff
-Office arcades/table tennis/pool is for recruitment only and will not be tolerated

Good salaries and great customers to work with.","The destruction of a very good company culture started September 2020 when the new CEO Mark Anderson was appointed. He changed many of the C-level executives including appointing the new CRO who is no longer with the company as of now. In his 6 weeks in this position Dean Darwin managed to demotivate and disgust many people. Eventually he was fired because of racist comments he left on Twitter and Linkedin. However, it took the company 1 week to make that decision and the CEO, his buddy from the past, even wanted to protect him.

Other than that the company has introduced MEDDPICC as a sales methodology and is creating more and more metrics to micromanage its employees. PG call days are blocked and activities are tracked. And this is just the beginning...

Many people were let go at the beginning of the year and many more to follow because they will not want to work in this depressing culture. The high turnover is accepted by senior management as they look to bring in people who would do what they want and how they want it.

Alteryx core products are still on-premis despite us living in the year 2021. When I was hired a few years ago I was told that the customers didnt care too much about it.

There is a great opportunity to succeed here if you make sure you get the right connections internally with management and suck up as needed","During the 2018 Christmas party the president and CRO of the company at the time (scott jones) was making sexual advances towards my date. 
The night culminating with him connecting and messaging her on social media platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn ( I have pictures). 
You can only imagine how that made me feel as an employee reporting under him. 
This alone is WILDY scary and as someone who has to work under someone like that, it drastically changed my views of our organization. 

High growth has masked a large lack of competency internally specifically in lower/mid level management. people have inherited roles they aren't qualified or prepared for and it rears it’s head in a number of different ways. 

Products outside of the designer are not great. 

They offer ""Alteryx for good"" hours which are meant to volunteer during work hours, naturally in sales you want to be there as often as you can but when i requested to use my ""afg"" hours i was greeted with a "" is that a good use of your time?"" 

Alteryx targets younger individuals to save costs but most people have been in college longer than they've been in the software industry. 

Some people have no sales background at all, lots of “buddy 6” hiring.

 Don't voice alternative views as management often sees this is combative or antagonistic. 

Then your ""personal brand"" gets tarnished, once that happens there's no coming back.

Pre-COVID, the company was willing to invest in in-person collaboration, including flying all 1,400+ (at the time) associates to Las Vegas in Feb. 2020 for our Global Kickoff (GKO). Our work transcends office, function, team and geographic locations. Post-COVID, the company made appropriate adjustments and maintained transparent communications. The team continues to make responsible decisions regarding work safety while creating new ways for associates to engage and adjust to our new environment. 

The executive team leads ethically and by example. The company is clear about direction and how each associate's responsibilities not only support these strategic imperatives but make an impact. 

Alteryx is a purpose-driven company and puts money where it's ""mouth"" is with Alteryx for Good. Associates are free to donate time and money to organizations they feel most passionate about.

their forecasting process is enough to drive you mad, heavily time consuming

major emphasis on activity metrics i.e. how many calls you make per day (report sent out to whole department daily), how many emails you send daily

there is zero BDR support (literally, there aren't any BDRs), it's on the AE to run full cycle pipeline build and closing business. There is the expectation that you perform the job of an AE and BDR all the time which is insane and leads to many many late nights to keep up. This wasn't an issue pre covid bc everyone sent out automated emails that led to meetings which dried up when the pandemic hit. 

Super corporate environment. 

lack of empathy for personal things, taking time off. Expectation is that you make up work on days when you're out which effectively means they dont believe in days off.

115,NOTHING is good enough and ZERO positive reinforcement,2.0,"The product you sell actually works and is beneficial. Higher than average salary and if you sell something, higher than average commission. Great benefits package.","Firstly, the ONLY reason I'm not going with a 1 star. During their initial orientation (referred to as ""boot camp"" there), the CEO of the company will walk in and before he even introduces himself he will open it with ""this will be the hardest job you'll ever have, but also the most rewarding"" and while I disagree with this job being rewarding whatsoever, he was upfront in it being a tough job.

Anyways, onto the cons. While I mentioned it being a pro, there is a reason the salary and the commission is so high here......this is a tough sale. You are cold calling, emailing, LinkedIn messaging 1,000+ businesses (which are provided to you) by researching the companies and researching the potential customers that fit the mold on LinkedIn, Zoom Info ETC. Out of 20 people you may get a hold of, you are lucky if MAYBE 1 of them wants to even hear you out (this is pretty standard in cold call sales).

This job is a grind, but to be fair, during the interview process, the managers are very upfront in this regard. I have 16 successful years in different types of sales and let me say, this is a completely different beast. The STRESS (read below) this job will put on you, you may want to re-consider before accepting an offer here.

So everything I've put so far, the pay is good, they were upfront with this being hard etc, so why do I list these as cons when I knowingly went into this?

With a new company there are learning curves.....systems, product etc. I was here for 8 months and toward the end I felt I knew the product/systems SOMEWHAT. It'd be one thing if this was just me but you can ask ANYONE there, and they'll all tell you it takes at least a year to feel somewhat comfortable with the product.

Onboarding was really where I knew things weren't going to go well. When I started, I sat in a different area away from the team I was on and not only away from my team, I sat with A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. In addition to this, after those 2 months, I was switched to a completely different team with a new manager.

My headline really says it all. There is absolutely ZERO positive reinforcement. The managers have done this job before so they know the grind and instead of giving you props for the things you did well and working with you on ways to improve the things you can do better, they only focus on the negative aspects. For example, if you create the most opportunities, instead of giving you kudos for that, it's just digging into why your other opportunities aren't progressing.......you could literally do 4 good things and if there was 1 thing to nitpick on, that's ALL that'd be focused on. I would absolutely DREAD the weekly 1:1's with my manager as I knew it was a hammer coming down on me for 30 minutes (which it ALWAYS was).

NEVER in my career have I ever felt worthless, lack of confidence etc, but at Alteryx, I felt like a legit worthless piece of crap day in and day out. My wife would tell me countless times that she has NEVER seen stress on my face until this job. Keep in mind, this was all during a pandemic where EVERYONE there was struggling (rightfully so), yet NOTHING was good enough and I can't even imagine what this job would be like post covid.",22 people found this review helpful,2020-07-31, Commercial Land Sales ,Irvine, CA,Former Employee, less than 1 year

121,Misguided direction from leadership time and time again,4.0,"Pretty developer-centric, although it used to be more so. (Teams used to have a lot more say in their own internal processes with many teams trying some pretty outlandish ideas back in the day.)

A lot of teams have very cool culture and vibe, and the company encourages that.

In recent years, the company has been very successful in internally modernizing/streamlining automated processes.

Compensation and benefits are very competitive.

The stock is on an explosive trajectory upward (in spite of what the rest of the industry/market seems to be doing).

A lot of cool problems being solved everyday in different codebases/languages/tech stacks across the organization.

I put a Neutral outlook on Dean (CEO). He is super gregarious and a great representative for the company/product/brand. His big data catchphrases simply grow trite; if you've heard a couple of Dean speeches, you've pretty much heard Dean. Very nice guy though and attempts to connect with and show appreciation for all areas of the org (although he is clearly a sales guy at heart).

6-month outlook will depend upon how releases of new product lines fare (and whether or not the user base embraces these new experiences). A lot of potential for success here, but also a lot of ways the company could misstep. e.g., Misrepresenting one of these new product lines as a replacement for the previous XYZ product line (or for the partner's/competitor's ABC product line) could aggravate users.","A lot of little pet projects- many of which flounder about wasting resources and never coming to fruition. Frustrating to see resources wasted on things that-- even if they do get completed-- the customers really don't want as much as leadership/management thinks they do.

Moreover, there is a large disconnect between leadership/management and our user base. Leadership/management is out of touch with our main product (Designer) and the niche value it provides. For example, having seen many years of quarterly innovation days, leadership/management does not contribute/participate. (Participation, otherwise, is usually very high across the company-- even outside of the engineering org.)

When the company wants to update/modernize a product line (e.g., server), the tendency has always been to rewrite all functionality from scratch. With decades-old legacy products and a bunch of rosy-eyed (usually newly-hired) developers, this leads to a lot of reinventing the wheel (in the best case) and a lot of new problems (in the worst case). This has happened time and time again with various iterations of lightweight, web-based versions of both the desktop and server products. Every time, there is a naivete (or perhaps hubris) that THIS rewrite will avoid all of the problems from the previous rewrites; more often, there are just new defects and anomalies being introduced (not all of which are being identified).

In response to diverging visions, there seems to be a tendency to terminate many passionate advocates for the main product (including the original CTO, who wrote this product himself). This has led to displaced/disjointed excitement for the product and an overall decrease in morale across (at least) the engineering org.",10 people found this review helpful,2020-06-16, Senior Software Engineer ,Broomfield, CO,Current Employee, more than 5 years

124,This place is toxic!,1.0,"The stock is doing well.  The offices are nice with free snacks and lunches sometimes.  Some people “in the trenches” are incredibly nice and hard-working people that I get to call friends.  The sales team seems happy.  If you’re looking for a toxic, fear-based culture, this is the place for you!","This place is chaotic, toxic and bordering on hostile.  Let’s start with the marketing team as that’s where I sit.  Marketing has struggled over the years and our latest CMO is the absolute worst.  Currently, everyone is off doing their own thing because there is nothing to align to.  The CMO values politics and continues to bring in minions that agree with her.  We have now lost a VP and Director in a month amidst the worst job market because they were tired of dealing with this chaos.  These losses have rocked teams across the org as both were considered high performers.  But, when people challenge the CMO and her tyrants, this so-called “leadership” will spread rumors to tarnish reputations and create a scapegoat for blame to always keep the needle pointed away from themselves.  Something as simple as spelling errors are met with lengthy meetings to discuss how the CMO and the CSO are right until people just say “yes, you are right”.  Duplicative work is being done across the org and no one knows what to trust causing confusion for colleagues across functions.  Customers are even getting unhappy with a product built on 20 year technology, lack of innovation and trust me, I know we will do a good job of putting lipstick on this pig to help the CEO maintain his billionaire status.  The CEO cares more about getting people back in the office than anything else and only shut down offices when required to by law.  The entire leadership team is a good ole boys club that rule based on loyalty and create anxiety and fear.  And the plan for the company? Reach a billion dollars in revenue. How are we going to get there? Any way possible.  There is no structure from the top and with around 1400 employees, this company is in desperate need of real leadership. There are just a lot of shady practices going on here, please here my desperation as I plead for happy souls to stay far far away, especially if considering a job in marketing.

My hope personal hope would be that I might persuade even one candidate to look elsewhere. Alteryx T-O-X-I-C! Starts with 80% of your colleagues who will be looking to tear you down and any other people they feel threatened by, the other 20% are just there for a paycheck. HR, of whom I will not mention any specific names, exemplifies incompetence. But they act as if they are coequals with Jesus himself. It is interesting to see the amount of reviews that refer to the culture as toxic and couldn't be more true. You will hear stories of things you'd only expect to hear on a lifetime movie. There have been dozens of great people who have left because management refuses to address the problems that pollute every organization in one way or another. But hey, let's continue to just hire people we know, it doesn't matter if they have the knowledge and leadership skills to perform the job. I would say 75% of the company comes from a handful of companies in the valley. Not because there is no other talent, but because candidates can see through the BS in their interview process and it leaves HR with no choice but to go find their friends from other companies. Which by the way it helps build out their clique. Once you join, be wary of the individuals who kissed your a - $ - $  to get you to join the company, only to become influencers of the rampant high school drama, backbiting, harassment and bullying.",19 people found this review helpful,2020-04-17, Associate ,Irvine, CA,Former Employee, more than 1 year

131,T O X I C culture. Alteryx is the new IBM without the job security.,1.0,"- The company is doing very well and back being a leader in the MQ, which was great news.
- The main product, Alteryx Designer, is a great product, although we are in 2020 and it is still a Desktop product. Analysts love it as it saves them lots of time. Great use cases.
- AYX is on fire, opportunity to make $$$ with shares. Compensation is ok.
- Free snacks and nice offices,
-Good folks I became friend with","- The company is becoming increasingly arrogant. The marketing is getting ridiculous, very quick to adopt any buzzword that would make us sound smart and innovative and that is increasingly becoming an embarrassment, especially if  (like me ) you work with partners who know the market well and try to implement real-world projects with Alteryx. 
We have been working on the new platform for years, partners have questions and are starting to question the attitude and arrogance displayed by the executive team. Oh yes, it is a public company, we need to please investors, everybody gets that but still, …
- As others have said on this page, the culture is super T O X I C,  you should take that seriously and be thorough in your evaluation before joining. There are of course some great people at Alteryx and some pockets where it is great to work but backstabbing is very common, along with people being let go without explanations, great talent suddenly leaving, several cliques, horrible managers promoted. On top of all of that, there is constant insecurity due to ever-changing priorities, direction and overall poor management skills. 
- Fear-based environment and lack of rules when it comes to promotion/advancement. Now it looks like everybody is getting promoted. (i was recently told I could get a promotion with 6 months to make me stick around). I d rather work in a great environment than getting a promotion. The company has grown too fast and people end up managing teams without the right experience nor support.
- Weak HR organization. It is very hard to ""be yourself"" despite the marketing campaign. Alteryx is taking the culture issue seriously and now, every 2 days, someone from the company talks about how amazing Alteryx is on social media. Isn’t that odd? People who are considering a job at Alteryx, ask yourself: does this look spontaneous or is it a marketing campaign?

4. The career path is also not very clear. I wasn't very sure how to step up to the next level as the company seems to put more layers above us.

5. It’s a sales-driven company (according to the size), so if you’re not in sales / or not related a lot to sales, you may not be thought about or forgotten in some scenario.

I've worked at alteryx for over a year and I can honestly say it's been a wonderful experience. I wanted to wait and see how alteryx would play out for me before writing a review, but now I can say that this truly is a great place to work. 

I've worked for both large companies, and small start ups, and experienced the ups and downs that come with working in those environments. Alteryx is actually an old company that is just now getting the recognition it deserves. The growth has been amazing, but it is not the unstable type growth that you see with hot start ups that just fizzles away in a year or two. Alteryx is built to last, and if you're looking for a stable job with a stable company that isn't going to vanish overnight, then this is the place for you. Alteryx also has a great culture with great people. People here love to connect and team building outings are encouraged regular. After a year here I feel like i've really been able to connect with my piers. That feels great after several years of working remote from home. Plus, alteryx will give you time to volunteer and give back to the community if that's important to you. 

But, it's no free ride. Alteryx expects your best, and if you give your best and work hard, you will be rewarded and recognized. That's rare these days, especially in tech where companies work you to death and expect 80+ hr work weeks only to pile more and more on you till you burn out. Alteryx cares about the career aspirations of its employees, and wants you to be happy in your role, and that has been refreshing for me. Bottom line is, if you work hard and have a growth mindset, alteryx will work out great for you.","- Benefits are OK for the sector

Our CEO is a founder who is completely out of touch with the company. When he speaks at all hands meetings I wish I had a dollar for every eye roll I see - he comes across as a phony person who doesn’t care about the little people. He started an “Alter-Us” initiative focused on diversity. What is hypocritical is that he hired a new COO who is a white male without trying to get some diverse leadership. After hearing the COO introduce himself it’s obvious that the CEO didn’t do anything to find a diverse candidate. He just hired someone from his network who seems to not even have a real COO background. If the CEO really cared about diversity he would have found a diverse candidate with a real COO background. The COO even made a comment about getting out of Miami because he didn’t speak Spanish. It came across as derogatory.

Millennial type of environment","Alteryx is very top heavy. There are too many Chiefs and not enough Indians. Half of them are not even qualified as managers. Most of them do not care about their employees and need to take management classes.

One of their initiatives are to retain top talents but they are doing the opposite by pushing talents out. It doesn't matter how hard you work, it's hard to be promoted within. A perfect example (keeping this as anonymous as possible to avoid retaliation), a former manager was working tirelessly and invested in the company as he put in many hours + weekends. Not to mention that he was undervalued/underpaid. His boss is clueless on how valuable he’s to the company. Instead of promoting this former manager or getting him help, his boss decided to hire a Director without communicating to him. When the manager left, it was a huge blow to the department and they finally realized that he does a lot. Management also encourages us to talk to the direct manager for career path and promotions. Wait…What!? If I go to my manager and ask for a promotion, I’ll be labelled as high maintenance. Shouldn't it be the other way around since they have the authority? So backwards!

Directors and above get a way with so many things. Why? One simple answer, buddy system. It’s who you know instead of what you know. Most of Directors and VPs know each other. I guess it’s a common practice when a company goes public and becomes a cooperate world instead of a company that cares about their employees and promotes within.

Communication here is just plain bad. The root cause? You got managers and above that do not understand the word manage, and they all think we are mind readers. It’s rather simple don’t you think?

203,"Cold, Disingenuous Leadership in Engineering",2.0,"Great people at the contributor levels .  The best and brightest I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  Benefits, as many have stated, are fantastic.  Alteryx really is still an OK place to work.  But it could be so much more.","When I talk about Alteryx it’s like having a discussion about a dear friend who has recently lost his way.

Simply put, engineering is plagued by the worst management I have ever witnessed (particularly at the Director level). This is not hyperbole. Many of us are sitting here wondering which bad decision it will be that will make it necessary for action to be taken on what we perceive as abundant examples of poor leadership. 

One would think that, with our company’s goal of becoming a billion dollar organization, we would want to double down on the culture that got us to the big leagues and, at the very least, be careful with whom we choose to be our leaders.  In particular, it’s important to insure that when we bring leaders into our company externally that those individuals not bring the same bad practices that plagued the organizations they are presumably fleeing.  Since 2016, our director has taken a wrecking ball to nearly everything that made Alteryx a great place to work.  Important decisions are made in back rooms about tools, technologies, and processes without the council and expertise of the people who are affected by these decisions.  Now, you are more likely to hear about what your team will look like or what tech stack you’ll be using from your manager than you are to be asked about what the best next move is.  Confusion is rampant across all teams about what our next gen strategy is after two years of knowing that a next gen platform is imminent.  We don’t know how to advance our careers and move up.  We do know not to mistake an open door for an opportunity to speak the truth.  We are people persecuted and furloughed for dissenting and being honest.  You toe the line, present a unified front, or you sit down and shut up.

Management is upside down - it presumes to know what’s best for contributors and has lost sight of the fact that they are public servants. Could we please have leaders who didn’t constantly trip over their own egos, hush people in meetings, and misinterpret the fortune of being lucky enough to lead incredibly intelligent people to mean that they have divine wisdom or insight that allows them to rule people instead of serve them?  It would be incredibly refreshing to have one of our leaders stand up and say, “OK, now I know I can find a lot of people who will agree with what I’m saying, but I want to hear from those who don’t”  It doesn’t take much to surround yourself with and trumpet feedback from people who always agree with you and pretend like dissent doesn’t exit or, worse, not even know it exists.  

If the now dozens of talented, experienced, tenured employees that have parted ways with us isn’t enough for us to wake up and realize something foul is amiss, what about the people who have voluntarily stepped down from leadership roles?  How much more will we need to hear about it “just being growing pains” or the “transition from small company mindedness” to “big company mindedness” or it taking a special person to be a leader rather than a contributor?  When are we going to address the elephants in the room?  

When did Alteryx become fixated on being so utterly average, like every other corporate American company?  We have an opportunity to be different.  To do things our way.  To be servants to our employees and customers first, and to our investors third.  Shouldn’t “a billion” really just be a bi-product of being an awesome place to work and having great customers who love us?  Our employees should feel excited to come to work because they are certain that their opinions and contributions matter.  No one wants to be dictated to and told after a big decision has been made.

Transparency is valued and this has been demonstrated to me on multiple occasions.

Many employees are afraid of speaking up or mentioning certain sacred cow topics because of the possibility of retaliation, which does happen. Upper management will say that their doors are always open, but this isn't fostering communication- it's creating a situation where the burden of fixing glaring issues falls on rank-and-file employees who face the risk of retaliation if they say the wrong thing. Issues don't get addressed; they get buried.
- Despite having a lot of great employees, Alteryx doesn't seem to intent on keeping them. Employee turnover is high and morale, at least in large parts of the organization, is low. Responses from senior management have mostly consisted of talking about issues unrelated to problems employees are actually concerned about. The turnover issue is rarely discussed and, when it is, it's typically dismissed outright.
- Profoundly outdated technology. The infrastructure related to things like testing, version control and builds is old, clunky and a significant drain on productivity. These complaints have been going around Engineering for a very long time, but senior management dismisses them every time they're brought up.
- Favoritism. Echoing another reviewer here, I heard some employees complain about senior management picking favorites, but I thought it was just sour grapes on their part. After having worked here for some time, though, it's true- there's an inner circle at Alteryx and, if you're not part of it, good luck climbing the ladder.
- Poor planning and resource allocation. It's not unusual to see teams have to change direction completely. Usually, this happens because of shifts in overall company priorities, but even priority areas often remain under-staffed and under-resourced while other projects lower on the list of priorities wind up stuffed to the gills with engineers. Increasingly, projects are being given ambitious deadlines before a clear plan of how to tackle the problem or what even needs to be done has been established.",23 people found this review helpful,2017-11-25, Anonymous Employee ,,,Current Employee,

They are an old company but they like to be projected as a  'Hot Startup'.  Work culture varies between 'ok- i can work here "" to ""it totally sucks' depending on where in the ladder you are and which team.

265,Big Data software provider a great place to work,5.0,"Alteryx is on the cutting edge of the Big Data revolution.  The company is pre-IPO / purchase, so there's real opportunity for those who get in in now.  The development organization is a full Scrum shop and it quite committed to being an agile workplace.   We just moved into a brand new spiffy office space in Broomfield which includes a complimentary gym on premises and company provided bikes for taking to lunch, etc.","Because our product is B@B, enterprise-level software, we're limited in how often we can release.  That means we're often working on 8 - 10 month release cycles which  can be challenging to keep agile.",5 people found this review helpful,2015-07-23, Anonymous Employee ,Broomfield, CO,Current Employee, more than 1 year

267,HR,5.0,"Alteryx is a growing organization with tons of momentum in the data blending and advanced analytic space. The employees are thoughtful, creative, dedicated.  Integrity and ingenuity is part of everything we all do, no matter what department we work for.  Upper management and executive leadership share a common vision of success and growth for the company and they take time to recognize the contributions of our various groups/teams.  The environment is a great mix of fun and focus and the work hours are flexible. Business casual everyday at some really great locations.

It's the first company where I don't dread opening my email every morning and enjoy seeing the team at the office.","Can't think of any...I do overindulge on the free snacks and beverages, so I may have gained a few extra lbs.",3 people found this review helpful,2015-07-17, Anonymous Employee ,Irvine, CA,Current Employee,
269,Marketing,3.0,Smart and extremely dedicated team.  A company that is poised for either a generous IPO or buy out.  Future appears bright.  Technology unmatched at the moment.,"While Marketing team is talented, the leadership sorely lacks in team and individual management skills; employee reviews were either missed and conducted late, employee growth and satisfaction (in the marketing office at least) is of marginal interest to mgmt.  The Alteryx Marketing office takes itself a bit too seriously and leadership is rather humorless.  A quiet and intense place to work.",5 people found this review helpful,2015-07-16, California ,San Mateo, CA,Current Employee, more than 3 years
270,Awesome Company,5.0,I really cant say enough about this company. I've had the good fortune to work here  for just over a year now and have seen the growth and opportunity first hand. The company advocates for their employees and this really shows through all they offer. The founders are brilliant and innovative leaders that push their employees to excel. It's a fun environment. We do events pretty regularly. The benefits are very generous. Casual work environment. Great team here with a family feel.

271,Innovative company with an awesome team!,5.0,"I am really glad I decided to join Alteryx. So far, my experience has been great. The interview process was quick and very efficient and the onboarding was more thorough than what I've seen at any other company. The people that I've met are very welcoming and genuinely interested in getting to know you. The product is awesome and very innovative, which you get to see for yourself during boot camp. During boot camp, the CEO actually came in, talked to everyone, shook our hands and sat in for the presentations. For me, that goes a long way.

Alteryx prides itself on the customer experience and I think this applies to their employees too. Everyone is working towards a common goal and Alteryx does a good job of making sure the employees feel appreciated. They offer some pretty cool perks and their benefits are phenomenal. Lastly, the culture is really positive and the people are humble.  Everyone is always looking for suggestions and ways to improve. I like that we're still evolving and the company listens to their employees and allows them to contribute ideas to make Alteryx the best it can be.","Within the time I've been at Alteryx, I haven't determined any.",8 people found this review helpful,2014-12-20, Anonymous Employee ,Irvine, CA,Current Employee, less than 1 year
272,"Fast Paced, Growing Company with Lots of Career Upside",4.0,"Alteryx is one of the few places where all aspects of a business are focused on the same thing - rapid growth of the number of happy customers. This has included how marketing invest, how the sales team is set up and how the product is developed. This provides a lot of clarity and focus for everyone. The company is growing really fast so there are lot of opportunities for people who are good at what they do.",As the company grows there is still a lot of change. This is inevitable when he company is expanding but also  but can at times be painful for individual employees but if you are part of this type of company you have to expect that.

Started as a consulting company with slow growth/pace, was always meant to be a “lifestyle” company. New management was brought on the help grow and sell the company. This has created a lot of strife and confusion between the old guard and new guard. Old guard is an anchor keeping the company from progressing.

274,Some really bad execs and worse managers.....,2.0,"There are some really smart, engaging people that work for this company and that actually makes it bearable.  The software is great (if you get the opportunity to learn how to use it), and overall if you're in a good office, you can have a positive experience at this company.","Some executives don't understand what it's like to be an ""up and coming"" company.  That being said, there are egos here from execs to managers and it's very discouraging.  It's been a while since I've worked with people who are pompous and arrogant and having to do so cheapens my overall professional experience with Alteryx.  Certain managers have a chip on their shoulder and believe that by agreeing with everything a Director/VP does keeps them in good graces.  There are quite a few total control freaks (from Execs to HR to Development to IT).  It's an odd place at times.",6 people found this review helpful,2014-04-15, Anonymous Employee ,,,Current Employee, less than 1 year
