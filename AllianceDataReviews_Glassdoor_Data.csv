2,Avoid,3.0,"Make your own schedule from Sunday to Saturday. In this position, you can log into the system and change your schedule the day/night before.
Generous pay with decent bonuses.
Nice amount of PTO. 
Ok insurance plan, pretty affordable and start within a week or two of you starting.
401k match (I believe it was 5% match). Immediately vested.
Lots of professional development, and learning opportunities.
Understanding supervisors who understood stuff happens and authorized time off in other jobs that wouldn't.
Some of the bosses (team leads, supervisors, and managers) really want to listen and improve themselves to be better bosses.
Lots of games/contests to win prizes (gift cards & cash).
Holiday dinners (during the lunch time) free. Yearly holiday bonus.
Can work remotely with nearly all of their positions.","Their computer systems are always going down. Their main systems were developed in house, I believe, and they keep those systems when other systems might be better. 
Customers make it stressful as they yell and are very demanding. Imagine having an argument for your whole shift as for many customers go to war to talk with us. 
Company does not care about the customers. All they care about is money (more on that later!)
Some of the team leads, supervisors, and managers do NOT care what goes on which violate laws and/or their own policy and procedures. (more on that later!)
They claim ""family"" environment, but it's just another job. You don't fire grandma, and they shouldn't either. 
They claim ""an open door policy"" but it isn't. Many individuals in power go behind your back and tell whatever you said to the person you were reporting. Or, they will ignore or take no action when they should. 
In the last three years they've been through 3 (yes, you read that right! THREE!) CEOs. Obviously, they DO NOT care about the employees as they claim (remember they said we're family, right?) nor do they care about the customers! 
They fire departments the day of without notice. Yes, they may have gotten a severance package, but remember they're family and have an open door policy. Why are you firing grandma, mom, brother and sister? (Obviously, I'm being factious here to a point, BUT you see they don't ""do as they say"" or what they publish.) They've had many lay offs recently to my knowledge, two in 2019, two in 2020 and one in 2021. 
They hire foreign people instead of local people to save money. Remember how former President Trump said to keep jobs here? Well, Alliance Data Systems did not care. They fired multiple departments. But, hey, we're family and have an open door policy (NOT!). 
Now more about my job - they do not care about the customers. They want them to pay all the fees. They LEGIT wanted us to waive only $5 of a $30/$40 late fee to help the customer out. I've never in my life had a creditor only offer a partial refund of a late fee. Also, we have to obtain many numbers so we have to get the customers to pay so many coworkers cheat to get them. Yes, you guessed it, the higher up positions simply do not care if you cheat as they do nothing if the person gets reported. 
In the end, you'll likely end up hating your life as you don't like the people you interact with: the customers and your coworkers. I now suffer from PTSD and very bad anxiety. 
Do not listen to all the fluff they say. Do what's best for you if you decide to work here. They see you just as a number. As you should see them, just as another employer who you do your job well and clock out. Don't let them make you feel bad if you can't participate in over time or their charities - they do do that, too, make you feel bad because YOU don't (or can't) work OT or donate to the charities they're sponsoring. In the end, I wouldn't recommend them but if you do decide to work there, please research them as I am not lying about anything I said.",Be the first to find this review helpful,2021-06-24, Collector ,Columbus, OH,Current Employee, more than 5 years

I can't speak to the environment currently, only what I experienced while there and right before I left in the summer of 2019. I watched it grow from a few thousand employees to well over 20,000 in the time I was there. It was an incredible experience and I was fortunate to learn from some of the best leaders at the company. The culture was fun and it was meaningful to be part of something bigger than any one business under the Alliance Data umbrella.  Up until the summer of 2019 things were great under Ed Heffernan's leadership and the other business leaders. After he left, things seemed to take a drastic turn and I left shortly afterwards.","It seemed the culture went from being about the people of the organization and the impacts employees were making for our clients and the community, to only being about the numbers and the bottom line. While I understand that stockholders are important and we are in the business to make revenue, the people part got lost. Optics are huge. People are a critical part of the success equation. I was once excited to go into work and by the end, I had lost that loving feeling.

135,"Poorly managed company, constant layoffs, no 2020 strategy",1.0,"The pay I got was pretty good, I was treated well by my manager and senior management. The office building I worked in was great, I got to travel a lot and no one ever complained about my food/drink charges (I kept them reasonable).","There are a LOT of cons right now. Let's recap.

June 2019: Alliance Data CEO Heffernan is asked to leave by the board and called a ""retirement"". Top exec Melisa Miller becomes CEO.
August 2019: Miller fires Pearson, the CEO of subsidiary LoyaltyOne. Talk going around is they want to sell it off like they did the other subsidiary Epsilon earlier.
Nov 2019: The ADS board interviews Andretta for COO. They decide he will make a great CEO, so they push aside Miller and appoint Andretta as CEO. Miller is out.

In a company like this where everyone is pushing everyone else out, how can one survive and build a long term career? ADS seems confused about what they want to do next. They seem to want to get rid of all their other businesses and just keep ADS Card Services, so the above moves are along those lines. This has caused a lot of uncertainty in LoyaltyOne and it's own subsidiaries and I got let go because of this along with a bunch of other people even though I was an important part of what we were doing. The only reason it makes logical sense to get rid of my role is that they want to sell the company in 2020 so don't want to spend money on a role that isn't going to make the company look good to a prospective buyer. The name may be LoyaltyOne but there is no loyalty anywhere to be found.

The most appalling thing for me was the general work culture. People walk in at 10am, lazily and yawning and start packing up to leave at 3pm and are out by 3:30pm. How can things get done? No one takes deadlines seriously and developers always have a ready list of excuses to explain why they could not get their assigned tasks done. Doctor appointment, cat got sick, TTC late etc etc. I have never been able to get my developers meet their agreed upon dates. Senior management has an overly aggressive agenda and complains that we miss dates, so when I communicate this to my developers, they get offended and complain to their managers up their chain and I hear from my manager that I was targeting them and how they felt bad. A bunch of snowflakes who have a nice relaxed gig in place and want to keep it that way.

Everyone seems to be more interested in poking their noses in other people's jobs and constantly giving out unsolicited advice and suggestions. If you don't take their suggestions, they get offended again. And people in the office actually sulk and make long faces when they are displeased. If it wasn't disrupting business, it would be hilarious. I was assigned to a person who does not do what I do and has never done that before. Instead of trusting me and my 10+ year experience, he would micromanage me on everything and give me detailed instructions on what to do. I knew some things would not lead to the right result, but he would not listen. At a point I decided it is better to just do what he said so as to avoid any friction. Everyone wants to be a leader with no responsibility for the results. Everything is done ""by committee"". If I make a recommendation to my boss on something that affects what I am responsible for, he would want to call a big meeting, spend an hour yakking about it, take everyone's opinion, then come up with a plan  of action that made everyone happy. Is that the way to run a business? No wonder the company is failing.

I am happy to be out of there and onto my next journey. There was no career path and for the last year I felt I was wasting away not doing anything impactful and that they were paying me a good amount of money but not using me.",9 people found this review helpful,2019-12-06, Director ,,,Former Employee, more than 3 years

Recently had to lay people off due to financial results. Has a policy with attendance that is unfriendly to any frontline associates -  firing people haphazardly despite medical and other unpreventable issues despite many solutions to SLA management being available - but ignored. Many leaders and associates have provided alternative options, strategies, solutions, and projects that would have drove exceptional financial results, but they don’t realize that the only way for those to get done is to get them out of their normal duties to get the work done. The unfortunate reality is that leadership is so overwhelmed with administrative duties, that information stopped flowing upstairs. This means the leadership is flying blind to the amazing talent in their staff and serious issues with their business - that are very risky. Leadership has to work through the weekend just to complete tasks that take them away from what they were hired to do and receives so many e-mails it’s literally impractical to expect a 24 hour response and get all the other duties done.",7 people found this review helpful,2019-10-31, Anonymous Employee ,Rio Rancho, NM,Former Employee, more than 3 years

DON'T work here! The turnover rate is 58% for a reason. The environment is toxic and abusive. You are treated like a piece of equipment that had better not have any problems or you are threatened with your job. If you become ill or have any personal emergencies you will be penalized and threatened with your job.  I wound up on short term disability due to illness and I almost wound up homeless because of the careless way AllianceData and their insurance company handled my claim and I caught both Alliance and the insurance company in lies regarding my claim. This place is unprofessional, and they will take anyone desperate for a job. If you are educated make sure you don't apply here because a degree is useless here, and your job will NEVER progress beyond being a phone monkey. Regardless of how the customers behave it is ALWAYS your fault and you will be threatened with your job if you can't make them love you or stop taking their own problems out on you. This job is fine for those suffering in food service or some other unskilled job, it's at least an office, but it is an office that uses people up until they can't take any more, and it's a dead end as far as progress or career goes. If you are someone who is educated, wanting to progress in life, and you expect to be treated like a human being, pass this place up, leave skid marks.  If you are uneducated,  have no real plans for your future,  you don't mind being treated like garbage, or an expendable nothing, and if you don't have enough on the ball to make it in a professional company, this is your dream job. If this company is professional, how can a CEO keep his job when turnover is THAT high? You will also be promoting products that have horridly HIGH interest rates and very angry customers. You have been warned!  If you lose your car or if you don't have one you really need to pass this place up.

219,Overall Great Company To Work For,4.0,"This was the best job I've ever had. I was paid over $15/hr and $16/hr after 5:30 PM.  The training was fun and my trainer made the learning process easy and fun for us! We learned a lot and spent a lot of time laughing and telling stories, but also made sure we knew what we were doing for when training was over. After four weeks of training we were allowed to sign up for overtime even while in nesting. After nesting (four weeks) we were given 72 hours of PTO to use at our disposal, and this was only for the first half of the year. If you don't use your PTO which is 154 hours total for the year, they'll cash you out for it. We got our own cubicles which we were allowed to decorate and I always had something to do while taking calls to keep me busy. I am great with dealing with rude customers and they don't get to me or affect me as much as other people so this was the perfect job for me. Time went by super fast each shift and they almost always offer VTO where you may be approved to leave early if that's what you want. The OT is unlimited as well. When it was slow (which was mostly at night at most weekends) it would be 5-20 minutes in between  calls and we were able to have down time to talk to co-workers or watch a movie on the flat screens etc. They have a kitchen with actual workers cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner as well as convenience type snack items as well. We also had the ability to switch schedules for a day or multiple days if it was approved which almost always were in my case. My schedule was 12:15-8:45, but i always got approved to switch to 8am-4:30 PM or they would send out emails about schedule changes on certain days that you can use. Unfortunately, I had to stop working here due to personal issues, but I'm eligible for rehire this month, and I pray I can go back! The culture is amazing and it doesn't feel like your working in a call center, especially compared to the gorss, small, cubicle/equipment sharing call centers I've worked at.","Only con would be the attendance policy! My training was in December and my car spun off the road on the highway on the way to work. (I took pictures of it and still came into work less than an hour late), but due to this I was not able to receive my holiday pay and I still received a point for being late, although it was out of my control. Also the surveys. I know I was a GREAT CCR.. they have policies in place regarding fees being waived, etc, and if a customer already received a late fee waiver we could only give them one if their account showed they were eligible, or if they threatened to close the account. No matter how nice, friendly, and empathetic you are, some of the customers will give you a bad survey simply because the policies in place prohibited you from doing whatever it is they wanted you to do. If you waive the late fee when you're not supposed to, you get an email and get in trouble, but if you don't and the customer leaves a bad survey, you get in trouble for that as well. I feel as though these should only count against us if we genuinely didn't do our best to assist the customer, we shouldn't be held accountable for customers being upset that we have to follow company policies.",4 people found this review helpful,2018-10-10, Customer Care Representative ,Lenexa, KS,Former Employee, less than 1 year

253,Extremely Stressful and Inconsistent,1.0,"Great benefits (matching 401k, health and life insurance).  A lot of time off is provided.   The managers are great at pretending to care.   Some of the zero calls are disputed. There is a facade of friendly culture and if you buy into it, you might enjoy this job.   Their music videos are incredible and put together by a professional team of editors.","The time off must be scheduled at least a month in advance or a penalty is given for using it.  It cannot be used as sick time . I was almost terminated for calling in twice because of the point system. Once because I had a dr's note and had laryngitis  and the other time because my daughter had croup .

No option to switch clients, once you're assigned to a bucket, you cannot be moved. 

They constantly mess up the scheduling and it takes weeks to fix.

Negative surveys that you have no control over are weighed more heavily than positive surveys where you genuinely helped the client. 

Extremely inconsistent.  The supervisors will not always back you up even if you're correct. You get  lectured on your stats and not waiving fees, then the supervisor turns around and waives a customer's entire balance. They will even try to talk you into breaking the rules to avoid taking the escalated call. 

It does not matter if you yourself are rated at 100%, if the company is rated zero even for something outside of your control, then the call is a failure and weighs heavily against you.

Favoritism. 

Associates who take easier shorter calls will be ranked higher than associates who take difficult longer calls, despite the former associates doing more to help the customer.  It is not about helping the customer, its just about numbers.

Not being allowed to hang up on abusive customers  takes a toll on mental health. Being micromanaged is tiring.

They will sit employees in a room and have all supervisors from all three sites on the phone and everyone will listen to the calls and rate them.  The associate in the hot seat is basically roasted by all the supervisors at once. It is not a private discussion between your supervisor and yourself, but instead a humiliating roast that shames you into doing better on your calls.  

The system is set up so someone is ALWAYS at the bottom. Even if everyone in the entire call center did amazing, there would still be at least 20 associates in the ""RED"" because the ranking system is set up to always have people at the bottom in the red. Not everyone can be green all at once.  

Training from other associates with less experience and knowledge.   They will have employees who are not even in your bucket and less tenure train you on how to take calls in your bucket.

For a Financial Institution they treat their workers pretty well.","Biggest Problems in Credit Risk: 
An outdated stack ranking system that highly prioritized engagement and enthusiasm over analytical rigor. 

The rest of the company seems to have realized these rankings don't optimize collaboration. 

Outdated work from home policies for the industry. The butt in seat mentality is the one thing that really undermines their focus on work/life balance. 



With notable exceptions, some managers did not do much to actually find work for their employees to do. 

Proactive planning for projects was not the norm. Too much putting out fires, not enough planning. 

Pay is generally lower than the industry average. 

All of SLT has been at the company their entire professional lives. This leads to a stronger preference for the status quo than some other places.  
There is also a noted preference for people who have been with the company for 10+ years, even if a number of those folks have weaker analytical skills than their newer counterparts.

Some months, I worked 15 hours per day and finally completed a multi million dollar project as per design and requirements. I got loooots of 'thank you' points from my co- worker, manager and also directors. But during project, sometime I was feeling, someone from upper management don't want this project to go on time. But really couldn't connect, why would someone wouldn't want a project to complete. Really meant no sense to me. Finally one day upper management called our group in a room and let everyone go.  A fortune 500 company showed their real face with dirty office politics. VP was afraid, he would be replaced by director if this project would go correctly. He started blaming for issues, that he had approved during early stage of the project.

456,"Great Company Values, but do they value you??",2.0,"Some good reasons to work at Alliance Data are:

The people they have as Customer Care Reps
The space (very positive colors on the wall so it doesn't feel like a call center)
They're the ""best company you never heard of"" and like to keep it that way.
They offer an onsite cafe, with fitness classes and paid weight watchers meetings.
They are very involved in the community, March was Harvesters, April is March of Dimes, etc.
Different teams handle different calls, for example one team handles calls up until 8 pm CST, at which time calls for the night basically cease (one or two here and there for the whole floor) so you're getting paid to sit there and do nothing, or you can VTO (Voluntarily take Time Off, unpaid of course.) and go home before your shift ends.","They don't value their employee's. They make like they do, but behind the scenes you can ask anybody and they'll tell you they don't. For instance, when I began working for Alliance Data and found out the hourly rate of others in my training class I brought to HR's attention that I had more experience and whatnot and they offered to negotiate a better rate with me, so long as I denied another job opportunity and as soon as I had done so at the request of an HR rep, they changed their minds.

Flash forward to 8 months in the future and while you're given 72 hours of PTO for 6 months of the year, and another 72 for the remaining half of the year (to be bid on at the beginning of each portion) they don't give you sick days, or leave, and if you so happen to be in a car accident they will deny paying you and instead take ALREADY SCHEDULED AND APPROVED time off to cover the time that you're out for the aforementioned reason.


Flash Forward another 2 months, and keep in mind they are still undervaluing you, still depreciating you, you are passed up for a promotion that was all but promised to you because of how much you're been contributing to the company and its successes, for somebody that was hired off the street.

Rapidly growing, lots of room for advancement.","PLEASE READ!
The company is very contradictory. Let me explain why. They are all about wanting you to do well and advance/grow into new positions. Here's what they don't tell you. If you start off in customer care like I did, this will be the BIGGEST mistake you'll make. The company has over 170+ clients, they group the calls into ""buckets"" and depending on your bucket, you'll either love it or hate it. I have online catalog. These are the worst customers you can deal with out of any bucket. They are all 50+ in age, and really shouldn't be allowed to have credit cards. You will be super stressed out everyday dealing with these calls. Let me explain rankings, it's really not that hard to rank. It consists of 3 main things to focus on. The most important part of working here is the team you are on, the supervisor you have, and your voice/csat score. You will NEVER get to switch positions if you don't consistently meet the VOICE/CSAT metric. Mostly CSAT. It's the overall customer satisfaction. It's really a lot harder to get a good survey score then you'd think. Especially if you have the online catalog bucket. You will do everything right and still get a bad score. If you don't have a good supervisor or team, this will also effect you. Your teams voice is 40% of your overall ranking, so no matter how well you do, if your team isn't doing well they will sink you down. Some of the supervisors really shouldn't be in their position. Basically, your experience really depends on whose team you will be on when you start.",6 people found this review helpful,2016-03-16, Customer Service Representative ,Thornton, CO,Current Employee, more than 1 year

472,A journey,3.0,"Working for Alliance Data was one of the most frustrating experiences of my life. I joined the company in 2004 and I loved most of the people I worked with, and liked the others.  The corporation cared about people. I watched them rescue small towns by buying call centers that were headed across the ocean. Alliance Data helped those with disabilities by offering meaningful opportunities, offered some of the best benefits you could ever ask for, and continually outperformed their competitors even during the downturn in 2008. When things got tough, they got creative. Alliance Data had a set of core values they made important: Communicate Openly, Work Together, Build Trust, Teach and Learn, and Innovate and Create.","Fast forward to 2012. Money was attracting different talent. Growth was out of control. Slowly, the changes started -both good and bad. An annual layoff cycle was started to weed out political rivals. Bullies were hired in favor of leaders.  Spending went out of control. The ones that tried to stop or slow down the insanity were caught in the next cycle and replaced by more bullies. Phrases like “get on board or get out” or “it’s not personal, it’s just business” replaced “how can we make it work” and “who else should we ask.”  A tyranny was blossoming.  I honestly felt I had been placed in a Dilbert comic strip from the 90's.

Our teams continued to accomplish the impossible. But this made our leaders angry. The leaders wanted us to fail. Every time we meat an impossible deadline (typically exceeding it) we were reprimanded for working too many hours and lost out on any reward.  Managers were given conflicting tasks to put them at odds and create conflict. Managers were punished for sharing any information with each other. The leaders at Alliance Data are actively trying to destroy it and no one seems to care.

Eventually, I too was caught in the latest round. I dared to speak out against a runaway project with no upside. I even came up with a plan to save the company the same amount each year (for the life of the company) to help them offset the albatross. I was let go within weeks after 12 years of exemplary service, numerous awards, and a loyal following. I was even told at my exit that I had great skills but I just wasn’t wanted there anymore. The leaders needed a different style of management.  I honestly was ok with all this.

534,Finally found a career worthy company!,5.0,"After submitting application, it only took about one week before I had a confirmed start date.
First day day training was engaging and helpful, and was supplemented incredibly well by the first month of paid training. 

   Now that I have been with the company for just under a year now I have seen some amazing things that I have never seen in a company I'll keep it as brief as possible.

Since my start with the company I have seen that the work I put in is not only rewarded with more responsibility, and possibilities, but also, acknowledgment from my direct supervisor and peers about a job well done. The culture at Alliance Data truly inspires my absolute best work. 
I also had a bout with cancer that lasted some time when my schedule had to be adjusted in quick and sometimes unpredictable ways. The company worked with my schedule, but more importantly they encouraged me and reminded me how excellent an employee I was to have, and how much they couldn't wait to have me back @ 100%. Warmed my heart.","The only con is not with the company. The only con that I can really present is this; the attitude of some of your fellow co-workers can be particularly negative at times. Although not insurmountable, it can present a challenge to staying positive. Not to worry! The negatrons work their way out, allowing the optimist primes to do some real good.",3 people found this review helpful,2015-07-14, Anonymous Employee ,Westminster, CO,Current Employee, less than 1 year
535,Growth and potential in some areas,3.0,"ADS is a growing company and affords opportunity in many areas.  The benefits are really good, the pay scale is great, and the company seems to care about the employees.  Many people seem to be very happy working there, but it really depends on where you are in the company.","The biggest con is the number of lifers here who have been drinking the Kool-Aid for years.  Depending on your area, you have to rely on these cliquey people to get things done, as they hoard knowledge and refuse to document it.  New ideas are met with suspicion or outright hostility.    Good luck getting anything completed if you upset  the old guard. 

The technology is outdated, and people here print everything,  It's impossible to get anything done without physical meetings.  Management considers newer technology a ""security risk"" even though anyone could walk out the door with sensitive information in his or her bag from the reams of it being printed.  

Managers are promoted because of tenure, not leadership skills, and they are woefully lacking in those.  They make a big deal out of people working remotely, because they don't manage by outcomes.  

If you want to work  with newer technology, in a collaborative and innovative environment, where you can drive your projects to completion,  don't look here.  Other areas may be better.",6 people found this review helpful,2015-07-08, Anonymous Employee ,Columbus, OH,Former Employee, more than 1 year

They catered to and promoted those people who were always happy and upbeat, even when they weren't typically very good at their jobs. Meanwhile, those who preferred to come in and focus on doing good quality work were frequently held back from moving up in the organization. I had the misfortune of working for a manager who was particularly incompetent and frequently passed the buck down to those underneath him.

The company has implemented a program that entitles customers (including the before mentioned abusive customers as well as their family or anyone they share an email with) to evaluate whether or not you are doing a good enough job, and you can be reprimanded and fired based on these surveys. The surveys do not include specifying information indicating who the customer spoke to and they have 10 days to complete it. Over 50% of the time the result of the survey has nothing to do with the interaction that customer has with you, however you are expected to accept the bad survey even if it isn't about you. Its unfair and often prevents people from making bonus. You can follow all guidelines, laws and requirements by the company but if the customer doesn't like what you say- you just won't have a job. Not only that but department managers are completely oblivious to real issues faced by associates, they have a ""talk off"" for every concern and make you feel like its JUST you... it causes high stress and declining respect for management decisions.

568,Proceed with caution,2.0,"- The company growth is tremendous and the resulting bonuses were generous the past few years
- CEO is highly personable and makes himself very visible to associates at offices across the U.S. through frequent ""road show"" meetings
- Ability to buy company stock at a discount is a nice benefit. The stock has appreciated immensely, and if it continues to do so you can profit pretty well.","- Over the last seven years or so, the culture at my office evolved to a strange place where it felt like there were high school cliques being driven by senior leadership. I understand the need to dress professionally for work, however in certain roles if you weren't dressed up in the latest-greatest fashions and accessorized to the hilt you weren't considered 'Alliance Data branded' by management. This could contribute to your career going nowhere. 
- The work life balance was very poor over the majority of my nearly 15 year career. With company growth came the constant need to deliver work for new clients in very difficult time frames. Also, some large existing clients have demanding work cultures that in turn can drive a very demanding work culture at Allliance Data. If you happen to  you service these particular client accounts, be prepared to work long hours. It's reasonable to expect that at times work will be busy and extra hours are needed, however, in my experience it was an almost constant expectation.
-  Mass company layoffs were handled with little sensitivity. My co-workers received no individual advance notification that their jobs were being eliminated in a re-organization. Impacted associates learned they were being laid off on day of termination. It was very disconcerting to watch co-workers toiling away at their desks one moment and then literally escorted out of the building the next because they had just learned their jobs were eliminated. I understand that jobs sometimes need to be eliminated in the corporate world, but there are much better ways to execute layoffs.

The facility has a community culture that is very encouraging through peer mentoring, coaching, and frequent training. They do try their very best to take care of their employees and constantly encourage them to grow with the company.

Let's not forget to mention that the benefits offered there is stellar. You get health benefits which the price can be cut in half if you participate in their health program.

Their current way of evaluating an associate's performance on the phone relies too heavily on the customer's bias. For instances, a customer gets a survey and is asked about their OVERALL experience, if they leave a negative score the ASSOCIATE catches the flak even if the experience was based on the business policy not the actual associate themselves. The worst part is, you cannot dispute the survey. 

Another aggravating issue is the growing pains. Alliance Data has grown exponentially the past several years and they continue grow. The problem is, they are not handling the growth properly. A lot of systems get rushed updates that become buggy when we on-board new clients. When systems get buggy, we get angry customers contacting our call centers asking what the heck is going on and our associates cannot give a definitive answer because upper-management is attempting to put out too many fires then they should.

Things that I (and other employees at my level) were seeing would go unnoticed by immediate supervisors and/or managers.
